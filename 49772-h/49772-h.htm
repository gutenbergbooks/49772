<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

THE PACKET-BOAT</h2>


<p>"<i>Low Braidge!</i>"</p>

<p>The people on deck bent over, some until heads touched
knees, others, more exactly calculating, just sufficiently to
clear the beams. The canal-boat passed beneath the bridge,
and all straightened themselves on their camp-stools. The
gentlemen who were smoking put their cigars again between
their lips. The two or three ladies resumed book or knitting.
The sun was low, and the sycamores and willows fringing the
banks cast long shadows across the canal. The northern
bank was not so clothed with foliage, and one saw an expanse
of bottom land, meadows and cornfields, and beyond, low
mountains, purple in the evening light. The boat slipped
from a stripe of gold into a stripe of shadow, and from a stripe
of shadow into a stripe of gold. The negro and the mule on
the towpath were now but a bit of dusk in motion, and now
were lit and, so to speak, powdered with gold-dust. Now the
rope between boat and towpath showed an arm-thick golden
serpent, and now it did not show at all. Now a little cloud of
gnats and flies, accompanying the boat, shone in burnished
armour and now they put on a mantle of shade.</p>

<p>A dark little girl, of twelve years, dark and thin, sitting aft
on the deck floor, her long, white-stockinged legs folded
decorously under her, her blue gingham skirt spread out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
her Leghorn hat upon her knees, appealed to one of the reading
ladies. "Aunt Serena, what is 'evolution'?"</p>

<p>Miss Serena Ashendyne laid down her book. "'Evolution,'"
she said blankly, "'what is evolution?'"</p>

<p>"I heard grandfather say it just now. He said, 'That man
Darwin and his evolution'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Miss Serena. "He meant a very wicked and
irreligious Englishman who wrote a dreadful book."</p>

<p>"Was it named 'Evolution'?"</p>

<p>"No. I forget just what it is called. 'Beginning'&mdash;No!
'Origin of Species.' That was it."</p>

<p>"Have we got it in the library at Gilead Balm?"</p>

<p>"Heavens! No!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Your grandfather wouldn't let it come into the house.
No lady would read it."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>Miss Serena returned to her novel. She sat very elegantly
on the camp-stool, a graceful, long-lined, drooping form in a
greenish-grey delaine picked out with tiny daisies. It was
made polonaise. Miss Serena, alone of the people at Gilead
Balm, kept up with the fashions.</p>

<p>At the other end of the long, narrow deck a knot of country
gentlemen were telling war stories. All had fought in the war&mdash;the
war that had been over now for twenty years and more.
There were an empty sleeve and a wooden leg in the group and
other marks of bullet and sabre. They told good stories, the
country gentlemen, and they indulged in mellow laughter.
Blue rings of tobacco-smoke rose and mingled and made a
haze about that end of the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>"How the gentlemen are enjoying themselves!" said placidly
one of the knitting ladies.</p>

<p>The dark little girl continued to ponder the omission from
the library. "Aunt Serena&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Hagar."</p>

<p>"Is it like 'Tom Jones'?"</p>

<p>"'Tom Jones'! What do you know about 'Tom Jones'?"</p>

<p>"Grandfather was reading it one day and laughing, and
after he had done with it I got it down from the top shelf and
asked him if I might read it, and he said, 'No, certainly not!
it isn't a book for ladies.'"</p>

<p>"Your grandfather was quite right. You read entirely too
much anyway. Dr. Bude told your mother so."</p>

<p>The little girl turned large, alarmed eyes upon her. "I
don't read half as much as I used to. I don't read except just
a little time in the morning and evening and after supper. It
would <i>kill</i> me if I couldn't read&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Miss Serena, "I suppose we shall continue
to spoil you!"</p>

<p>She said it in a very sweet voice, and she patted the child's
arm and then she went back to "The Wooing O't." She was
fond of reading novels herself, though she liked better to do
macramé work and to paint porcelain placques.</p>

<p>The packet-boat glided on. It was almost the last packet-boat
in the state and upon almost its last journey. Presently
there would go away forever the long, musical winding of the
packet-boat horn. It would never echo any more among the
purple hills, but the locomotive would shriek here as it
shrieked elsewhere. Beyond the willows and sycamores,
across the river whose reaches were seen at intervals, gangs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of convicts with keepers and guards and overseers were at
work upon the railroad.</p>

<p>The boat passing through a lock, the dark little girl stared,
fascinated, at one of these convicts, a "trusty," a young white
man who was there at the lock-keeper's on some errand and
who now stood speaking to the stout old man on the coping
of masonry. As the water in the lock fell and the boat was
steadily lowered and the stone walls on either hand grew
higher and higher, the figure of the convict came to stand far
above all on deck. Dressed hideously, in broad stripes of
black and white, it stood against the calm evening sky, with
a sense of something withdrawn and yet gigantic. The face
was only once turned toward the boat with its freight of people
who dressed as they pleased. It was not at all a bad face,
and it was boyishly young. The boat slipped from the lock
and went on down the canal, between green banks. The
negro on the towpath was singing and his rich voice floated
across&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"For everywhere I went ter pray,<br />
I met all hell right on my way."<br />
</div>

<p>The country gentlemen were laughing again, wrapped in the
blue and fragrant smoke. The captain of the packet-boat
came up the companionway and passed from group to group
like a benevolent patriarch. Down below, supper was cooking;
one smelled the coffee. The sun was slipping lower, in the
green bottoms the frogs were choiring. Standing in the prow
of the boat a negro winded the long packet-boat horn. It
echoed and echoed from the purple hills.</p>

<p>The dark little girl was still staring at the dwindling lock.
The black-and-white figure, striped like a zebra, was there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
yet, though it had come down out of the sky and had now
only the green of the country about and behind it. It grew
smaller and smaller until it was no larger than a black-and-white
woodpecker&mdash;it was gone.</p>

<p>She appealed again to Miss Serena. "Aunt Serena, what
do you suppose he did?"</p>

<p>Miss Serena, who prided herself upon her patience, put
down her book for the tenth time. "Of whom are you speaking,
Hagar?"</p>

<p>"That man back there&mdash;the convict."</p>

<p>"I didn't notice him. But if he is a convict, he probably
did something very wicked."</p>

<p>Hagar sighed. "I don't think <i>anybody</i> ought to be made to
dress like that. It&mdash;it smudged my soul just to look at it."</p>

<p>"Convicts," said Miss Serena, "are not usually people of
fine feelings. And you ought to take warning by him never
to do anything wicked."</p>

<p>A silence while the trees and the flowering blackberry
bushes went by; then, "Aunt Serena&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"The woman over there with the baby&mdash;she says her husband
got hurt in an accident&mdash;and she's got to get to him&mdash;and
she hasn't got any money. The stout man gave her
something, and I <i>think</i> the captain wouldn't let her pay.
Can't I&mdash;wouldn't you&mdash;can't I&mdash;give her just a little?"</p>

<p>"The trouble is," said Miss Serena, "that you never know
whether or not those people are telling the truth. And we
aren't rich, as you know, Hagar. But if you want to, you
can go ask your grandfather if he will give you something
to give."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The dark little girl undoubled her white-stockinged legs,
got up, smoothed down her blue gingham dress, and went forward
until the tobacco-smoke wrapped her in a fragrant fog.
Out of it came, genially, the Colonel's voice, rich as old
madeira, shot like shot silk with curious electric tensions and
strains and agreements, a voice at once mellifluous and capable
of revealments demanding other adjectives, a voice that
was the Colonel's and spoke the Colonel from head to heel.
It went with his beauty, intact yet at fifty-eight, with
the greying amber of his hair, mustache, and imperial; with
his eyes, not large but finely shaped and coloured; with his
slightly aquiline nose; with the height and easy swing of his
body that was neither too spare nor too full. It went with him
from head to foot, and, though it was certainly not a loud
voice nor a too-much-used one, it quite usually dominated
whatever group for the moment enclosed the Colonel. He
was speaking now in a kind of energetic, golden drawl. "So
he came up to me and said, 'Dash it, Ashendyne! if gentlemen
can't be allowed in this degenerate age to rule their own
households and arrange their own duels&mdash;'" He became
aware of the child standing by him, and put out a well-formed,
nervous hand. "Yes, Gipsy? What is it you want now?"</p>

<p>Hagar explained sedately.</p>

<p>"Her husband hurt and can't get to him to nurse him?"
said the Colonel. "Well, well! That's pretty bad! I suppose
we must take up a collection. Pass the hat, Gipsy!"</p>

<p>Hagar went to each of the country gentlemen, not with the
suggested hat, but with her small palm held out, cupped.
One by one they dropped into it quarter or dime, and each,
as his coin tinkled down, had for the collector of bounty a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
drawling, caressing, humorous word. She thanked each gentleman
as his bit of silver touched her hand and thanked
with a sedate little manner of perfection. Manners at Gilead
Balm were notoriously of a perfection.</p>

<p>Hagar took the money to the woman with the baby and
gave it to her shyly, with a red spot in each cheek. She was
careful to explain, when the woman began to stammer thanks,
that it was from her grandfather and the other gentlemen and
that they were anxious to help. She was a very honest little
girl, with an honest wish to place credit where it belonged.</p>

<p>Back beside Miss Serena she sat and studied the moving
green banks. The sun was almost down; there were wonderful
golden clouds above the mountains. Willow and sycamore,
on the river side of the canal, fell away. Across an
emerald, marshy strip, you saw the bright, larger stream,
mirror for the bright sky, and across it in turn you saw limestone
cliffs topped with shaggy woods, and you heard the
sound of picks against rock and saw another band of convicts,
white and black, making the railroad. The packet-boat
horn was blown again,&mdash;long, musical, somewhat mournfully
echoing. The negro on the towpath, riding sideways on his
mule, was singing still.</p>

<p>"Aunt Serena&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Hagar."</p>

<p>"Why is it that women don't have any money?"</p>

<p>Miss Serena closed her book. She glanced at the fields and
the sky-line. "We shall be at Gilead Balm in ten minutes.&mdash;You
ask too many questions, Hagar! It is a very bad habit
to be always interrogating. It is quite distinctly unladylike."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

GILEAD BALM</h2>


<p>At the Gilead Balm landing waited Captain Bob with a
negro man to carry up to the house the Colonel's portmanteau
and Miss Serena's small leather trunk. The packet-boat
came in sight, white and slow as a deliberate swan, drew reflectively
down the shining reach of water, and sidled to the
landing. The Colonel shook hands with all the country gentlemen
and bowed to the ladies, and the country gentlemen
bowed to Miss Serena, who in turn bent her head and smiled,
and the captain said good-bye, and the Colonel gave the attendant
darky a quarter, and the woman with the baby came
to that side of the boat and held for a moment the hand of
the dark little girl, and then the gangplank was placed and
the three Ashendynes passed over to the Colonel's land. The
horn blew again, long, melodious; the negro on the towpath
said, "Get up!" to the mule. Amid a waving of hands and
a chorus of slow, agreeable voices the packet-boat glided
from the landing and proceeded down the pink water between
the willows and sycamores.</p>

<p>Captain Bob, with his hound Luna at his heels, greeted the
returning members of the family: "Well, Serena, did you
have a pleasant visit? Hey, Gipsy, you've grown a week!
Well, Colonel?"</p>

<p>The Colonel shook hands with his brother. "Very pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
time, Bob! Good old-time people, too good for this damned
new-fangled world! But&mdash;" he breathed deep. "I am glad
to get home. I am always glad to get home. Well? Everything
all right?"</p>

<p>"Right as a trivet! The Bishop's here, and Mrs. LeGrand.
Came on the stage yesterday."</p>

<p>"That's good news," said the Colonel. "The Bishop's
always welcome, and Mrs. LeGrand is most welcome."</p>

<p>The four began to walk toward the house, half a mile away,
just visible among great trees. The dark little girl walked
beside the hound, but the hound kept her nose in Captain
Bob's palm. She was fond of Hagar, but Captain Bob was
her god. As for Captain Bob himself, he walked like a curious,
unfinished, somewhat flawed and shortened suggestion of his
brother. He was shorter than the Colonel and broader; hair,
nose, eyes, mouth were nothing like so fine; carriage and port
were quite different; he lacked the <i>cachet</i>, he lacked the <i>grand
air</i>. For all that, the fact that they were brothers was evident
enough. Captain Bob loved dogs and hunting, and read the
county newspaper and the sporting almanac. He was not
complex. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred he acted from
instinct and habit, and the puzzling hundredth time he beat
about for tradition and precedent. He was good-natured and
spendthrift, with brains enough for not too distant purposes.
Emotionally, he was strongest in family affection. "Missed
you all!" he now observed cheerfully. "Gilead Balm's been
like a graveyard."</p>

<p>"How is mother?" asked Miss Serena. She was picking
her way delicately through the green lane, between the evening
primroses, the grey-green delaine held just right. "She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
wrote me that she burned her hand trying the strawberry
preserves."</p>

<p>"It's all right now. Never saw Old Miss looking better!"</p>

<p>The dark little girl turned her dark eyes on Captain Bob.
"How is my mother?"</p>

<p>"Maria? Well, I should say that she was all right, too. I
haven't heard her complain."</p>

<p>"Gad! I wish she would complain," ejaculated the Colonel.
"Then one could tell her there was nothing to complain
about. I hate these women who go through life with a smile
on their lips and an indictment in their eyes&mdash;when there's
only the usual up and down of living to indict. I had rather
they would whine&mdash;though I hate them to whine, too. But
women are all cowards. No woman knows how to take the
world."</p>

<p>The dark little girl, who had been walking between the
Colonel and Captain Bob, began to tremble. "Whoever
else's a coward, my mother's not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think, father, you ought&mdash;"</p>

<p>Captain Bob was stronger yet. He was fond of Gipsy, and
he thought that sometimes the family bore too hardly on
Maria. Now and then he did a small bit of cloudy thinking,
and when he did it he always brought forth the result with a
certain curious clearing of the throat and nodding of the head,
as though the birth of an idea was attended with considerable
physical strain. "No, Colonel," now he said, "you oughtn't!
Damn it, where'd we be but for women anyhow? As for
Maria&mdash;I think you're too hard on Maria. The chief trouble
with Maria is that she isn't herself an Ashendyne. Of
course, she can't help that, but I think it is a pity. Always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
did think that men ought to marry at least fifth or sixth
cousins. Bring women in without blood and traditions of people
they've got to live with&mdash;of course, there's trouble
adapting. Seen it a score of times. Maria's just like the rest
when they're not cousins. Ought somehow to be cousins."</p>

<p>"Bob, you are a perfect fool," remarked the Colonel.</p>

<p>He walked on, between the primroses, his hands behind
him, tall and easy in his black, wide-skirted coat and his soft
black hat. The earth was in shadow, but the sky glowed carnation.
Against it stood out the long, low red-brick house of
Gilead Balm. At either gable end rose pyramidal cedars,
high and dark against the vivid sky. In the lane there was
the smell of dewy grass, and on either hand, back from the
vine-draped rail fences, rolled the violet fields. Somewhere in
the distance sounded the tinkling of cow bells. The ardent
sky began to pale; the swallows were circling above the chimneys
of Gilead Balm, and now the silver Venus came out
clear.</p>

<p>The little girl named Hagar lagged a little going up the
low hill on which the house stood. She was growing fast, and
all journeys were exciting, and she was taking iron because
she wasn't very strong, and she had had a week of change and
had been thinking hard and was tired. She wanted to see her
mother, and indeed she wanted to see all at Gilead Balm, for,
unlike her mother, she loved Gilead Balm, but going up the
hill she lagged a little. Partly it was to look at the star and to
listen to the distant bells. She was not aware that she observed
that which we call Nature with a deep passion and
curiosity, that beauty was the breath of her nostrils, and
that she hungered and thirsted after the righteousness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
knowledge. She only came slowly, after many years, into
that much knowledge of herself. To-day she was but an undeveloped
child, her mind a nebula just beginning to spiral.
In conversation she would have applied the word "pretty"
indiscriminately to the flushed sky, the star, the wheeling
swallows, the yellow primroses. But within, already, the
primroses struck one note, and the wheeling swallows another,
and the sky another, and the star another, and, combined,
they made a chord that was like no other chord. Already her
moments were distinguished, and each time she saw Gilead
Balm she saw, and dimly knew that she saw, a different
Gilead Balm.</p>

<p>She climbed the hill a little stumblingly, a dark, thin child
with braided, dusky hair. She was so tired that things went
into a kind of mist&mdash;the house and the packet-boat and the
lock and the convict and the piping frogs and the cat-tails in
a marsh and the word "evolution."... And then, up on the
low hilltop, Dilsey and Plutus lit the lamps, and the house
had a row of topaz eyes;&mdash;and here was the cedar at the
little gate, and the smell of box&mdash;box smell was always of a
very especial character, dark in hue, cool in temperature,
and quite unfathomably old. The four passed through the
house gate and went up the winding path between the box
and the old, old blush roses&mdash;and here was the old house
dog Roger fawning on the Colonel&mdash;and the topaz eyes
were growing bigger, bigger....</p>

<p>"I am glad to get home," said Miss Serena, in front. "It's
curious how, every time you go from home, something happens
to cure you of a roving disposition."</p>

<p>Captain Bob laughed. "Never knew you had a roving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
disposition, Serena! Luna here, now,&mdash;Luna's got a roving
disposition&mdash;haven't you, old girl?"</p>

<p>"Luna," replied Miss Serena with some asperity, "Luna
makes no effort to alter her disposition. I do. Everybody's
got tendencies and notions that it is their bounden duty to
suppress. If they don't, it leads to all kind of changes and
upheavals.&mdash;And that is what I criticize in Maria. She
makes no effort, either. It's most unfortunate."</p>

<p>The Colonel, in front of them all, moved on with a fine
serenity. He had taken off his hat, and in the yet warm glow
the grey-amber of his hair seemed fairly luminous. As he
walked he looked appreciatively up at the evening star. He
read poetry with a fine, discriminating, masculine taste, and
now, with a gesture toward the star, he repeated a line of
Byron. Maria and her idiosyncrasies troubled him only
when they stood actually athwart his path; certainly he had
never brooded upon them, nor turned them over in his hand
and looked at them. She was his son's wife&mdash;more, he was
inclined to think, the pity! She was, therefore, Ashendyne,
and she was housed at Gilead Balm. He was inclined to be
fond of the child Hagar. As for his son&mdash;the Colonel, in his
cooler moments, supposed, damn it! that he and Medway
were too much alike to get on together. At any rate, whatever
the reason, they did not get on together. Gilead Balm
had not seen the younger Ashendyne for some years. He
was in Europe, whence he wrote, at very long intervals, an
amiable traveller's letter. Neither had he and Maria gotten
on well together.</p>

<p>The house grew large, filling all the foreground. The topaz
eyes changed to a wide, soft, diffused light, pouring from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
windows and the open hall door. In it now appeared the
figures of the elder Mrs. Ashendyne, of the Bishop, and
Mrs. LeGrand, coming out upon the porch to welcome the
travellers.</p>

<p>Hagar took her grandmother's kiss and Mrs. LeGrand's
kiss and the Bishop's kiss, and then, after a few moments of
standing still in the hall while the agreeable, southern voices
rose and fell, she stole away, went up the shallow, worn stairway,
turned to the left, and opened the door of her mother's
room. She opened it softly. "Uncle Plutus says you've got
a headache."</p>

<p>Maria's voice came from the sofa in the window. "Yes,
I have. Shut the door softly, and don't let us have any light.
But I don't mind your sitting by me."</p>

<p>The couch was deep and heaped with pillows. Maria's
slight, small form was drawn up in a corner, her head high,
her hands twisted and locked about her knees. She wore a
soft white wrapper, tied beneath her breast with a purple
ribbon. She had beautiful hair. Thick and long and dusky,
it was now loosened and spread until it made a covering for
the pillows. Out from its waves looked her small face, still
and exhausted. The headache, after having lasted all day,
was going away now at twilight. She just turned her dark
eyes upon her daughter. "I don't mind your lying down
beside me," she said. "There's room. Only don't jar my
head&mdash;" Hagar lay carefully down upon the couch, her
head in the hollow of her mother's arm. "Did you have a
good time?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... Pretty good."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"There was another little girl named Sylvie. We played
in the hayloft, and we made willow baskets, and we cut
paper dolls out of a 'Godey's Lady's Book.' I named mine
Lucy Ashton and Diana Vernon and Rebecca, and she didn't
know any good names, so I named hers for her. We named
them Rosalind and Cordelia and Vashti. Then there was
a lady who played backgammon with me, and I read two
books."</p>

<p>"What were they?"</p>

<p>"One was 'Gulliver's Travels.' I didn't like it altogether,
though I liked some of it. The other was Shelley's 'Shorter
Poems.' Oh"&mdash;Hagar rose to a sitting posture&mdash;"I liked
that better than anything I've <i>ever</i> read&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are young to be reading Shelley," said her mother.
She spoke with her lips only, her young, pain-stilled face
high upon the pillows. "What did you like best?"</p>

<p>Hagar pondered it. "I liked the 'Cloud,' and I liked the
'West Wind,' and I liked the 'Spirit of Night'&mdash;"</p>

<p>Some one tapped at the door, and then without waiting for
an answer opened it. The elder Mrs. Ashendyne entered.
Hagar slipped from the sofa and Maria changed her position,
though very slightly. "Come in," she said, though Mrs.
Ashendyne was already in.</p>

<p>"Old Miss," as the major part of Gilead Balm called her,
Old Miss crossed the room with a stately tread and took the
winged chair. She intended tarrying but a moment, but she
was a woman who never stood to talk. She always sat down
like a regent, and the standing was done by others. She was a
large woman, tall rather than otherwise, of a distinct comeliness,
and authoritative&mdash;oh, authoritative from her black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
lace cap on her still brown, smoothly parted hair, to her low-heeled
list shoes, black against her white stockings! Now
she folded her hands upon her black stuff skirt and regarded
Maria. "Are you better?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you."</p>

<p>"If you would take my advice," said Mrs. Ashendyne,
"and put horseradish leaves steeped in hot water to your
forehead and the back of your neck, you would find it a
great relief."</p>

<p>"I had some lavender water," said Maria.</p>

<p>"The horseradish would have been far better. Are you
coming to supper?"</p>

<p>"No, I think not. I do not care for anything. I am not
hungry."</p>

<p>"I will have Ph&oelig;be fetch you a little thin chipped beef and
a beaten biscuit and a cup of coffee. You must eat.&mdash;If you
gave way less it would be better for you."</p>

<p>Maria looked at her with sombre eyes. At once the fingers
slipped to other and deeper notes. "If I gave way less....
Well, yes, I do give way. I have never seen how not to. I
suppose if I were cleverer and braver, I should see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What I mean," said Old Miss with dignity, "is that the
Lord, for his own good purposes,&mdash;and it is <i>sinful</i> to question
his purposes,&mdash;regulated society as it is regulated, and
placed women where they are placed. No one claims&mdash;certainly
I don't claim&mdash;that women as women do not see a
great deal of hardship. The Bible gives us to understand that
it is their punishment. Then I say take your punishment
with meekness. It is possible that by doing so you may help
earn remission for all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"There was always," said Maria, "something frightful to
me in the old notion of whipping-boys for kings and princes.
How very bad to be the whipping-boy, and how infinitely
worse to be the king or prince whose whipping-boy you
were!"</p>

<p>A red came into Mrs. Ashendyne's face. "You are at
times positively blasphemous!" she said. "I do not at all see
of what, personally, you have to complain. If Medway is
estranged from you, you have probably only yourself to
thank&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never wish," said Maria, "to see Medway again."</p>

<p>Medway's mother rose with stateliness from the winged
chair. "When it comes to statements like that from a wife,
it is time for old-fashioned people like myself to take our
leave.&mdash;Ph&oelig;be shall bring you your supper. Hagar, you
had better come with me."</p>

<p>"Leave Hagar here," said the other.</p>

<p>"The bell will ring in ten minutes. Come, child!"</p>

<p>"Stay where you are, Hagar. When the bell rings, she
shall come."</p>

<p>The elder Mrs. Ashendyne's voice deepened. "It is hard
for me to see the mind of my son's child perverted, filled
with all manner of foolish queries and rebellions."</p>

<p>"Your son's child," answered Maria from among her pillows,
"happens to be also my child. His family has just had
her for a solid week. Now, pray let me have her for an hour."
Her eyes, dark and large in her thin, young face, narrowed
until the lashes met. "I am perfectly aware of how deplorable
is the whole situation. If I were wiser and stronger and
more heroic, I suppose I should break through it. I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
I should go away with Hagar. I suppose I should learn to
work. I suppose I should somehow keep us both. I suppose
I might live again. I suppose I might ... even ...
get a divorce&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her mother-in-law towered. "The Bishop shall talk to you
the first thing in the morning&mdash;"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

THE DESCENT OF MAN</h2>


<p>A pool of June sunlight lay on the library floor. It made a
veritable Pool of Siloam, with all around a brown, bank-like
duskiness. The room was by no means book-lined, but there
were four tall mahogany cases, one against each wall, well
filled for the most part with mellow calf. Flanking each case
hung Ashendyne portraits, in oval, very old gilt frames. Beneath
three of these were fixed silhouettes of Revolutionary
Ashendynes; beneath the others, war photographs, <i>cartes de
visite</i>, a dozen in one frame. There was a mahogany escritoire
and mahogany chairs and a mahogany table, and, before
the fireplace, a fire-screen done in cross-stitch by a colonial
Ashendyne. The curtains were down for the summer, and
the dark, polished floor was bare. The room was large, and
there presided a pleasant sense of unencumbered space and
coolness.</p>

<p>In the parlour, across the hall, Miss Serena had been allowed
full power. Here there was a crocheted macramé lambrequin
across the mantel-shelf, and a plush table-scarf
worked with chenille, and fine thread tidies for the chairs, and
a green-and-white worsted "water-lily" mat for the lamp,
and embroidery on the piano cover. Here were pelargoniums
and azaleas painted on porcelain placques, and a painted
screen&mdash;gladioli and calla lilies,&mdash;and autumn leaves
mounted on the top of a small table, and a gilded milking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
stool, and gilded cat-tails in decalcomania jars. But the
Colonel had barred off the library. "Embroider petticoat-world
to the top of your bent&mdash;but don't embroider books!"</p>

<p>The Colonel was not in the library. He had mounted his
horse and ridden off down the river to see a brother-in-law
about some piece of business. Ashendynes and Coltsworths
fairly divided the county between them. Blood kin and marriage
connections,&mdash;all counted to the seventeenth degree,&mdash;traditional
old friendships, old acquaintances, clients,
tenants, neighbours, the coloured people sometime their servants,
folk generally, from Judge to blacksmith,&mdash;the two
families and their allies ramified over several hundred square
miles, and when you said "the county," what you saw were
Ashendynes and Coltsworths. They lived in brick houses set
among green acres and in frame houses facing village streets.
None were in the least rich, a frightful, impoverishing war being
no great time behind them, and many were poor&mdash;but
one and all they had "quality."</p>

<p>The Colonel was gone down the river to Hawk Nest. Captain
Bob was in the stable yard. Muffled, from the parlour,
the doors being carefully closed, came the notes of "Silvery
Waves." Miss Serena was practising. It was raspberry-jam
time of year. In the brick kitchen out in the yard Old Miss
spent the morning with her knitting, superintending operations.
A great copper kettle sat on the stove. Between it and
the window had been placed a barrel and here perched a half-grown
negro boy, in his hands a pole with a paddle-like cross-piece
at the further end. With this he slowly stirred, round
and round, the bubbling, viscous mass in the copper kettle.
Kitchen doors and windows were wide, and in came the hum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of bees and the fresh June air, and out floated delectable
odours of raspberry jam. Old Miss sat in an ample low chair
in the doorway, knitting white cotton socks for the Colonel.</p>

<p>The Bishop&mdash;who was a bishop from another state&mdash;was
writing letters. Mrs. LeGrand had taken her novel out
to the hammock beneath the cedars. Upstairs, in her own
room, in a big four-poster bed, lay Maria, ill with a low fever.
Dr. Bude came every other day, and he said that he hoped
it was nothing much but that he couldn't tell yet: Mrs.
Ashendyne must lie quiet and take the draught he left, and
her room must be kept still and cool, and he would suggest
that Ph&oelig;be, whom she seemed to like to have about her,
should nurse her, and he would suggest, too, that there be
no disturbing conversation, and that, indeed, she be left in the
greatest quiet. It seemed nervous largely&mdash;"Yes, yes,
that's true! We all ought to fight more than we do. But the
nervous system isn't the imaginary thing people think! She
isn't very strong, and&mdash;wrongly, of course&mdash;she dashes
herself against conditions and environment like a bird against
glass. I don't suppose," said Dr. Bude, "that it would be
possible for her to travel?"</p>

<p>Maria lay in the four-poster bed, making images of the
light and shadow in the room. Sometimes she asked for
Hagar, and sometimes for hours she seemed to forget that
Hagar existed. Old Miss, coming into the room at one of
these times, and seeing her push the child from her with a
frightened air and a stammering "I don't know you"&mdash;Old
Miss, later in the day, took Hagar into her own room, set her
in a chair beside her, taught her a new knitting-stitch, and explained
that it would be kinder to remain out of her mother's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
room, seeing that her presence there evidently troubled her
mother.</p>

<p>"It troubles her sometimes," said Hagar, "but it doesn't
trouble her most times. Most times she likes me there."</p>

<p>"I do not think you can judge of that," said her grandmother.
"At any rate, I think it best that you should stay
out of the room. You can, of course, go in to say good-morning
and good-night.&mdash;Throw the thread over your finger like
that. Mimy is making sugar-cakes this morning, and if you
want to you can help her cut them out."</p>

<p>"Grandmother, please let me go <i>four</i> times a day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. I do not consider it best for either of you. You
heard the doctor say that your mother must not be agitated,
and you saw yourself, a while ago, that she did not seem to
want you. I will tell Ph&oelig;be. Be a good, obedient child!&mdash;Bring
me the bag yonder, and let's see if we can't find enough
pink worsted for a doll's afghan."</p>

<p>That had been two days ago. Hagar went, morning and
evening, to her mother's room, and sometimes Maria knew
her and held her hands and played with her hair, and sometimes
she did not seem to know her and ignored her or talked
to her as a stranger. Her grandmother told her to pray for
her mother's recovery. She did not need the telling; she loved
her mother, and her petitions were frequent. Sometimes she
got down on her knees to make them; sometimes she just
made them walking around. "O God, save my mother. For
Jesus' sake. Amen."&mdash;"O God, let my mother get well.
For Jesus' sake. Amen."&mdash;She had finished the pink afghan,
and she had done the dusting and errands her grandmother
appointed her. This morning they had let her arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the flowers in the bowls and vases. She always liked to do
that, and she had been happy for almost an hour&mdash;but
then the feeling came back....</p>

<p>The bright pool on the library floor did not reach to the
bookcases. They were all in the gold-dust powdered umber
of the rest of the room. Hagar standing before one of them,
first on a hassock, and then, for the upper shelves, on a chair,
hunted something to read. "Ministering Children"&mdash;she
had read it. "Stepping Heavenward"&mdash;she had read it.
"Home Influence" and "Mother's Recompense"&mdash;she had
read them. Mrs. Sherwood&mdash;she had read Mrs. Sherwood&mdash;many
volumes of Mrs. Sherwood. In after life it was only
by a violent effort that she dismissed, in favour of any other
India, the spectre of Mrs. Sherwood's India. "Parent's Assistant
and Moral Tales"&mdash;she knew Simple Susan and
Rosamond and all of them by heart. "Rasselas"&mdash;she had
read it. "Scottish Chiefs"&mdash;she had read it. The forms of
Wallace and Helen and Murray and Edwin flitted through
her mind&mdash;she half put out her hand to the book, then withdrew
it. She wasn't at all happy, and she wanted novelty.
Miss Mühlbach&mdash;"Prince Eugene and His Times"&mdash;"Napoleon
and Marie Louise"&mdash;she had read those, too.
"The Draytons and the Davenants"&mdash;she half thought she
would read about Olive and Roger again, but at last she
passed them by also. There wasn't anything on that shelf
she wanted. She called it the blue and green and red shelf,
because the books were bound in those colours. Miss Serena's
name was in most of these volumes.</p>

<p>The shelf that she undertook next had another air. To
Hagar each case had its own air, and each shelf its own air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and each book its own air. "Blair's Rhetoric"&mdash;she had
read some of that, but she didn't want it to-day. "Pilgrim's
Progress"&mdash;she knew that by heart. "Burke's Speeches"&mdash;"Junius"&mdash;she
had read "Junius," as she had read many
another thing simply because it was there, and a book was
a book. She had read it without much understanding, but
she liked the language. Milton&mdash;she knew a great part of
Milton, but to-day she didn't want poetry. Poetry was for
when you were happy. Scott&mdash;on another day Scott
might have sufficed, but to-day she wanted something new&mdash;so
new and so interesting that it would make the hard, unhappy
feeling go away. She stepped from the hassock upon
the chair and began to study the titles of the books on almost
the top shelf.... There was one in the corner, quite
out of sight unless you were on a chair, right up here, face to
face with the shelf. The book was even pushed back as though
it had retired&mdash;or had been retired&mdash;behind its fellows so
as to be out of danger, or, perhaps, out of the way of being
dangerous. Hagar put in her slender, sun-browned hand and
drew it forward until she could read the legend on the back&mdash;"The
Descent of Man." She drew it quite forth, and bringing
both hands into play opened it. "By Charles Darwin."
She turned the leaves. There were woodcuts&mdash;cuts that
exercised a fascination. She glanced at the first page: "He
who wishes to decide whether man is the modified descendant
of some preëxisting form&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hagar turned upon the chair and looked about her. The
room was a desert for solitude and balmy quiet. Distantly,
through the closed parlour doors, came Miss Serena's rendering
of "Monastery Bells." She knew that her grandfather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
was down the river, and that her grandmother was making
raspberry jam. She knew that the Bishop was in his room,
and that Mrs. LeGrand was out under the cedars. Uncle
Bob did not count anyway&mdash;he rarely asked embarrassing
questions. She may have hesitated one moment, but no
more. She got down from the chair, put it back against the
wall, closed the bookcase door, and taking the "Descent of
Man" with her went over to the old, worn horsehair sofa
and curled herself up at the end in a cool and slippery hollow.
A gold-dust shaft, slipping through the window, lit her
hair, the printed page, and the slim, long-fingered hand that
clasped it.</p>

<p>Hagar knew quite well what she was doing. She was going
to read a book which, if her course were known, she would
be forbidden to read. It had happened before now that she
had read books under the ban of Gilead Balm. But heretofore
she had always been able to say that she had not known
that they were so, had not known she was doing wrong. That
could not be said in this case. Aunt Serena had distinctly
told her that Charles Darwin was a wicked and irreligious
man, and that no lady would read his books.... But then
Aunt Serena had unsparingly condemned other books which
Hagar's mind yet refused to condemn. She had condemned
"The Scarlet Letter." When Gilead Balm discovered Hagar
at the last page of that book, there had ensued a family discussion.
Miss Serena said that she blushed when she thought
of the things that Hagar was learning. The Colonel had not
blushed, but he said that such books unsettled all received
notions, and while he supported her he wasn't going to have
Medway's child imbibing damned anarchical sentiments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
any type. Old Miss said a number of things, most of which
tended toward Maria. The latter had defended her daughter,
but afterwards she told Hagar that in this world, even if you
didn't think you were doing wrong, it made for all the
happiness there seemed to be not to do what other people
thought you ought not to do.... But Hagar didn't believe
yet that there was anything wrong in reading "The Scarlet
Letter." She had been passionately sorry for Hester, and she
had felt&mdash;she did not know why&mdash;a kind of terrified pity
for Mr. Dimmesdale, and she had loved little Pearl. She had
intended asking her mother what the red-cloth letter that
Hester Prynne wore meant, but it had gone out of her mind.
The chapter she liked best was the one with little Pearl
playing in the wood.... Perhaps Aunt Serena, having been
mistaken about that book, was mistaken, too, about Charles
Darwin.</p>

<p>Neither now nor later did she in any wise love the feel of
wrong-doing. Forbidden fruit did not appeal to her merely because
it was forbidden. But if there was no inner forbidding,
if she truly doubted the justice or authority or abstract
rightness of the restraining hand, she was capable of attaining
the fruit whether forbidden or no. There was always the
check of great native kindliness. If what she wanted to
do was going&mdash;no matter how senselessly&mdash;to trouble or
hurt other people's feelings, on the whole she wouldn't do
it. In the case of this June day and the "Descent of Man"
the library was empty. She only wanted to look at the pictures
and to run over the reading enough to see what it was
about&mdash;then she would put it back on the top shelf. She was
not by nature indirect or secretive. She preferred to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
straightforwardly, to act in the open. But if the wall of not-agreed-in
objection stood too high and thick before her, she
was capable of stealing forth in the dusk and seeking a way
around it. Coiled now in the cool hollow of the sofa, half in
and half out of the shaft of sunshine, she began to read.</p>

<p>The broad band of gold-dust shifted place. Miss Serena,
arrived at the last ten minutes of her hour and a half at the
piano, began to play "Pearls and Roses." Out in the brick
kitchen Old Miss dropped a tablespoonful of raspberry jam
into a saucer, let it cool, tasted, and pronounced it done. The
negro boy and Mimy between them lifted the copper kettle
from the stove. Upstairs in Gilead Balm's best room the
Bishop folded and slipped into an addressed envelope the last
letter he was going to write that morning. Out under the
cedars Mrs. LeGrand came to a dull stretch in her novel. She
yawned, closed the book, and leaned back against the pillows
in the hammock.</p>

<p>Mrs. LeGrand was fair and forty, but only pleasantly
plump. She had a creamy skin, moderately large, hazel eyes,
moderately far apart, a small, straight nose, a yielding mouth,
and a chin that indubitably would presently be double. She
was a widow and an orphan. Married at nineteen, her husband,
the stars of a brigadier-general upon his grey collar,
had within the year fallen upon some one of the blood-soaked
battle-grounds of the state. Her father, the important bearer
of an old, important name, had served the Confederacy well
in a high civil capacity. When the long horror of the war was
over, and the longer, miserable torture of the Reconstruction
was passing, and a comparative ease and pale dawn of prosperity
rose over the state, Mrs. LeGrand looked about her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
from the remnant of an old plantation on the edge of a tidewater
town. The house was dilapidated, but large. The
grounds had Old Neglect for gardener, but they, too, were
large, and only needed Good-Care-at-Last for complete rehabilitation.
Mrs. LeGrand had a kind of smooth, continuous,
low-pressure energy, but no money. "A girls' school,"
she murmured to herself.</p>

<p>When she wrote, here and there over the state, it was at
once seen by her correspondents that this was just the thing
for the daughter of a public man and the widow of a gallant
officer. It was both ladylike and possible.... That was some
years ago. Mrs. LeGrand's School for Young Ladies was now
an established fact. The house was repaired, the grounds
were trim, there was a corps of six teachers, with prospects
of expansion, there were day pupils and boarding pupils. Mrs
LeGrand saw in her mind's eye long wing-like extensions to
the main house where more boarding pupils might be accommodated....
She was successful, and success agreed with
her. The coat grew sleek, the cream rose to the top, every
angle disappeared; she was warmly optimistic, and smooth,
indolent good company. In the summer-time she left Eglantine
and from late June to September shared her time between
the Springs and the country homes of kindred, family
connections, or girlhood friends. She nearly always came for
a fortnight or more to Gilead Balm.</p>

<p>Now, leaning back in the hammock, the novel shut, her
eyes closed, she was going pleasantly over to herself the additions
and improvements to be carried out at Eglantine.
From this her mind slipped to her correspondence with a
French teacher who promised well, and thence to certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
letters received that week from patrons with daughters. One
of these, from a state farther south, spoke in highest praise
of Mrs. LeGrand's guardianship of the young female mind, of
the safe and elegant paths into which she guided it, and of her
gift generally for preserving dew and bloom and ignorance of
evil in her interesting charges. Every one likes praise and no
one is so churlish as to refuse a proffered bouquet or to doubt
the judgment of the donor. Mrs. LeGrand experienced from
head to foot a soft and amiable glow.</p>

<p>For ten minutes longer she lay in an atmosphere of balm,
then she opened her eyes, drew her watch from her white-ribbon
belt, and glancing at it surmised that by now the
Bishop might have finished his letters. Upon this thought
she rose, and paced across the bright June grass to the house.
"Pearls and Roses" floated from the parlour. Her hand
on the doorknob, Mrs. LeGrand paused irresolutely for
a moment, then lightly took it away and crossed the hall
to the library. A minute later the Bishop, portly and fine,
letters in his hand, came down the stairs, and turned toward
this room. The mail-bag always hung, he remembered, by
the library escritoire. Though he was a large man, he moved
with great lightness; he was at once ponderous and easy.
Miss Serena at the piano could hardly have heard him
pass the door, so something occult, perhaps, made her ignore
the <i>da capo</i> over the bar of "Pearls and Roses" which she
had now reached. She struck a final chord, rose, closed the
piano, and left the parlour.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

THE CONVICT</h2>


<p>"My dear Bishop!" exclaimed Mrs. LeGrand; "won't you
come here and talk to this little girl?"</p>

<p>"To Hagar?" answered the Bishop. "What is the trouble
with Hagar? Have you broken your doll, poor dear?" He
came easily across to the horsehair sofa, a good man, by
definition, as ever was. "What's grieving you, little
girl?"</p>

<p>"I think that it is Hagar who may come to grieve others,"
said Mrs. LeGrand. "I do not suppose it is my business to
interfere,&mdash;as I should interfere were she in my charge at
Eglantine,&mdash;but I cannot but see in my daily task how difficult
it is to eradicate from a youthful mind the stain that has
been left by an improper book&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An improper book! What are you doing, Hagar, with an
improper book?"</p>

<p>The Bishop put out his hand and took it. He looked at the
title and at the author's name beneath, turned over a dozen
pages, closed the book, and put it from him on the cold, bare
mahogany table. "It was not for this that I christened you,"
he said.</p>

<p>Miss Serena joined the group.</p>

<p>"Serena," appealed Mrs. LeGrand, "<i>do</i> you think Hagar
ought to be allowed to contaminate her mind by a book like
that?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Serena looked. "That child!&mdash;She's been reading
Darwin!"</p>

<p>A slow colour came into her cheeks. The book was shocking,
but the truly shocking thing was how absolutely Hagar
had disobeyed. Miss Serena's soul was soft as wax, pliant as
a reed to the authorities her world ranged before her. By an
inevitable reaction stiffness showed in the few cases where
she herself held the orb of authority. To be disobeyed was
very grievous to her. Where it was only negligence in regard
to some command of her own,&mdash;direction to a servant, commands
in her Sunday-School class,&mdash;she had often to put
up with it, though always with a swelling sense of injury.
But when things combined, when disobedience to Serena
Ashendyne was also disobedience to the constituted authorities,
Miss Serena became adamant.</p>

<p>Now she looked at Hagar with a little gasp, and then, seeing
through the open door the elder Mrs. Ashendyne entering
from the kitchen, she called to her. "Mother, come here a
moment!"...</p>

<p>"If she had said that she was sorry," pronounced the
Bishop, "you might forgive her, I think, this time. But if she
is going to harden her heart like that, you had best let her see
that all sin, in whatever degree, brings suffering. And I should
suit, I think, the punishment to the offence. Hagar told me
only yesterday that she had rather read a book than gather
cherries or play with dolls, or go visiting, or anything. I
think I should forbid her to open any book at all for a week."</p>

<p>Behind Gilead Balm, beyond the orchard and a strip of
meadow, sprang a ridge of earth, something more than a hill,
something less than a low mountain. It was safe, dry, warm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and sandy, too cut-over and traversed to be popular with
snakes, too within a stone's throw of the overseer's house
and the overseer's dogs to be subject to tramps or squirrel-hunting
boys, just wooded enough and furrowed with shallow
ravines to make it to children a romantic, sprite-inhabited
region. When children came to Gilead Balm, as sometimes,
in the slow, continuous procession through the houses of a
people who traditionally kept "open house," they did come,
Hagar and they always played freely and alone on the home-ward-facing
side of the ridge. When the overseer's grandchildren,
too, came to visit him, they and Hagar played here,
and sometimes Mary Magazine, Isham and Car'line's ten-year-old
at the Ferry, was allowed to spend the day, and she
and Hagar played together on the ridge. Hagar was very
fond of Mary Magazine.</p>

<p>One day, having completed her circle of flower dolls before
her companion's was done, she leaned back against the apple
tree beneath which the two were seated and thoughtfully
regarded the other's down-bent brown face and "wrapped"
hair. "Mary Magazine, you couldn't have been named
'Mary Magazine.' You were named Mary Magdalene."</p>

<p>"No'm," said Mary Magazine, a pink morning-glory in one
hand and a blue one in the other. "No'm. I'm named Mary
Magazine. My mammy done named me for de lady what
took her cologne bottle somebody give her Christmas, an'
poured it on her han' an' rubbed Jesus' feet."</p>

<p>When Mary Magazine didn't come to Gilead Balm and
no children were staying in the house, and the overseer's
grandchildren were at their home on the other side of the
county, Hagar might&mdash;provided always she let some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
know where she was going&mdash;Hagar might play alone on the
ridge. To-day, having asked the Colonel if she might, she was
playing there alone.</p>

<p>"Playing" was the accepted word. They always talked of
her as "playing," and she herself repeated the word.</p>

<p>"May I go play awhile on the ridge?"</p>

<p>"I reckon so, Gipsy. Wear your sunbonnet and don't get
into any mischief."</p>

<p>At the overseer's house she stopped to talk with Mrs.
Green, picking pease in the garden. "Mahnin', Hagar," said
Mrs. Green. "How's yo' ma this mahnin'?"</p>

<p>"I think she's better, Mrs. Green. She laughed a little this
morning. Grandmother let me stay a whole half-hour, and
mother talked about <i>her</i> grandmother, and about picking up
shells on the beach, and about a little boat that she used to go
out to sea in. She said that all last night she felt that boat
beneath her. She laughed and said it felt like going home.&mdash;Only"&mdash;Hagar
looked at Mrs. Green with large, wistful
eyes&mdash;"only home's really Gilead Balm."</p>

<p>"Of course it is," said Mrs. Green cheerfully. She sat down
on an overturned bucket between the green rows of pease,
and pushed back her sunbonnet from her kind, old wrinkled
face. "I remember when yo' ma came here jest as well. She
was jest the loveliest thing!&mdash;But of course all her own
people were a good long way off, and she was a seafarer herself,
and she couldn't somehow get used to the hills. I've
heard her say they jest shut her in like a prison.... But
then, after a while, you came, an' I reckon, though she says
things sometimes, wherever you are she feels to be home.
When it comes to being a woman, the good Lord has to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
in com-pensation somewhere, or I don't reckon none of us
could stand it.&mdash;I'm glad she's better."</p>

<p>"<i>I'm</i> glad," said Hagar. "Can I help you pick the pease,
Mrs. Green?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, child, but I've about picked the mess. You
goin' to play on the ridge? I wish Thomasine and Maggie
and Corker were here to play with you."</p>

<p>"I wish they were," said Hagar. Her eyes filled. "It's a
very lonesome day. Yesterday was lonesome and to-morrow's
going to be lonesome&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Haven't you got a good book? I never see such a child
for books."</p>

<p>Two tears came out of Hagar's eyes. "I was reading a
book Aunt Serena told me not to read.&mdash;And now I'm not
to read <i>anything</i> for a whole week."</p>

<p>"Sho!" exclaimed Mrs. Green. "What did you do that
for? Don't you know that little girls ought to mind?"</p>

<p>Hagar sighed. "Yes, I suppose they ought.... I wish I had
now.... It's so lonesome not to read when your mother's
sick and grandmother won't let me go into the room only just
a little while morning and evening."</p>

<p>"Haven't you got any pretty patchwork nor nothin'?"</p>

<p>Hagar standing among the blush roses, looked at her with
sombre eyes. "Mrs. Green, I hate to sew."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Mrs. Green. "That's an awful thing to
say!"</p>

<p>She sat on the overturned bucket, between the pale-green,
shiny-podded peavines, her friendly old face, knobbed and
wrinkled like a Japanese carving, gleaming from between the
faded blue slats of her sunbonnet, and she regarded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
child before her with real concern. "I wonder now," she
said, "if you're goin' to grow up a rebel? Look-a-here,
honey, there ain't a mite of ease and comfort on that road."</p>

<p>"That's what the Yankees called us all," said Hagar.
'Rebels.'"</p>

<p>"Ah, I don't mean 'rebel' that-er-way," said Mrs. Green.
"There's lonelier and deeper ways of rebellin'. You don't
get killed with an army cheerin' you, and newspapers goin'
into black, and a state full of people, that were 'rebels' too,
keepin' your memory green,&mdash;what happens, happens just
to you, by yourself without any company, and no wreaths of
flowers and farewell speeches. They just open the door and
put you out."</p>

<p>"Out where?"</p>

<p>"Out by yourself. Out of this earth's favour. And, though
we mayn't think it," said Mrs. Green, "this earth's favour
is our sunshine. It's right hard to go where there isn't any
sunshine.... I don't know why I'm talking like this to you&mdash;but
you're a strange child and always were, and I reckon
you come by it honest!" She rose from among the peavines.
"Well, I've been baking apple turnovers, and they ain't
bad to picnic on! Suppose you take a couple up on the
ridge with you."</p>

<p>There grew, on the very top of the ridge, a cucumber tree
that Hagar loved. Underneath was a little fine, sparse grass
and enough pennyroyal to make the place aromatic when the
sunshine drew out all its essence, as was the case to-day.
Over the light soil, between the sprigs of pennyroyal, went a
line of ants carrying grains of some pale, amber-clear substance.
Hagar watched them to their hill. When, one by one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
they had entered, a second line of foragers emerged and went
off to the right through the grass. In a little time these, too,
reappeared, each carrying before her a tiny bead of the amber
stuff. Hagar watched, elbows on ground and chin on hands.
She had a feeling that they were people, and she tried giving
them names, but they were so bewilderingly alike that in a
moment she could not tell which was "Brownie" and which
"Pixie" and which "Slim." She turned upon her back and
lying in the grass and pennyroyal saw above her only blue
sky and blue sky. She stared into it. "If the angels were
sailing like the birds up there and looking down&mdash;and looking
down&mdash;we people might seem all alike to them&mdash;all
alike and not doing things that were very different&mdash;all
alike.... Only there are our clothes. Pink ones and blue
ones and white ones and black ones and plaid ones and striped
ones&mdash;" She stared at the blue until she seemed to see step
after step of blue, a great ladder leading up, and then she
turned on her side and gazed at Gilead Balm and, a mile
away, the canal and the shining river.</p>

<p>She could see many windows, but not her mother's window.
She had to imagine that. Lonesomeness and ennui, that had
gone away for a bit in the interest of watching the ants, returned
full force. She stood up and cast about for something
to break the spell.</p>

<p>The apple turnovers wrapped in a turkey-red, fringed napkin,
rested in a small willow basket upon the grass. Hagar
was not hungry, but she considered that she might as well
eat a turnover, and then that she might as well have a party
and ask a dozen flower dolls. Her twelve years were as a moving
plateau&mdash;one side a misty looming landscape of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
mind, older and higher than her age would forecast; on the
other, green, hollow, daisy-starred meadows of sheer childhood.
Her attention passed from side to side, and now it
settled in the meadows.</p>

<p>She considered the grass beneath the cucumber tree for a
dining-room, and then she grew aware that she was thirsty,
and so came to the conclusion that she would descend the
back side of the ridge to the spring and have the party
there. Crossing the hand's breadth of level ground she began
to climb down the long shady slope toward a stream that
trickled through a bit of wood and a thicket, and a small,
ice-cold spring in a ferny hollow. The sun-bathed landscape,
river and canal and fields and red-brick Gilead Balm with its
cedars, and the garden and orchard, and the overseer's
house sank from view. There was only the broad-leaved
cucumber tree against the deep blue sky. The trunk of the
cucumber tree disappeared, and then the greater branches,
and then the lesser branches toward the top, and then the
bushy green top itself. When Hagar and the other children
played on the ridge, they followed her lead and called this
side "the far country." To them&mdash;or perhaps only to Hagar&mdash;it
had a clime, an atmosphere quite different from the
homeward-facing side.</p>

<p>When she came to the spring at the foot of the ridge she was
very thirsty. She knelt on a great sunken rock, and, taking
off her sunbonnet, leaned forward between the fern and mint,
made a cup of her hands and drank the sparkling water. When
she had had all she wished, she settled back and regarded
the green, flowering thicket. It came close to the spring, filling
the space between the water and the wood, and it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
wild, luxuriant tangle. Hagar's fancy began to play with it.
Now it was a fairy wood for Thumbelina&mdash;now Titania and
Oberon danced there in the moonlight&mdash;now her mind gave
it height and hugeness, and it was the wood around the
Sleeping Beauty. The light-winged minutes went by and
then she remembered the apple turnovers.... Here was the
slab of rock for the table. She spread the turkey-red napkin
for cloth, and she laid blackberry leaves for plates, and
put the apple turnovers grandly in the middle. Then she
moved about the hollow and gathered her guests. Wild rose,
ox-eye daisy, Black-eyed Susan, elder, white clover, and
columbine&mdash;quite a good party.... She set each with due
ceremony on the flat rock, before a blackberry-leaf plate,
and then she took her own place facing the thicket, and after
a polite little pause, folded her hands and closed her eyes.
"We will say," she said, "a silent Grace."</p>

<p>When she opened her eyes, she opened them full upon other
eyes&mdash;haggard, wolfishly hungry eyes, looking at her from
out the thicket, behind them a body striped like a wasp....</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to scare you," said the boy, "but if you
ever went most of two days and a night without anything to
eat, you'd know how it felt."</p>

<p>"I never did," said Hagar. "But I can imagine it. I wish I
had asked Mrs. Green for <i>five</i> apple turnovers." As she spoke,
she pushed the red fringed napkin with the second turnover
toward him. "Eat that one, too. I truly don't want any, and
the flowers are never hungry."</p>

<p>He bit into the second turnover. "It seems mean to eat up
your tea-party, but I'm 'most dead, and that's the truth&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hagar, sitting on the great stone with her hands folded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
her lap and her sunbonnet back on her shoulders, watched her
suddenly acquired guest. He would not come clear out of the
thicket; the tangled growth held him all but head and shoulders.
"I believe I've seen you before," she said at last.
"About two weeks ago grandfather and Aunt Serena and I
were on the packet-boat. Weren't you at the lock up the
river? The boat went down and down until you were standing
'way up, just against the sky. I am almost sure it was
you."</p>

<p>He reddened. "Yes, it was me." Then, dropping the arm
that held the yet uneaten bit of turnover, he broke out. "I
didn't run away while I was a trusty! I wouldn't have
done it! One of the men lied about me and said dirty words
about my people, and I jumped on him and knocked his head
against a stone until he didn't come to for half an hour!
Then they did things to me, and did what they called degrading
me. 'No more trustying for you!' said the boss. So I
run away&mdash;three days ago." He wiped his forehead with
his sleeve. "It seems more like three years. I reckon they've
got the dogs out."</p>

<p>"What have they got the dogs out for?"</p>

<p>"Why, to hunt me. I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice sunk. Terror came back, and will-breaking fear,
a chill nausea and swooning of the soul. He groaned and half
rose from the thicket. "I was lying here till night, but I
reckon I'd better be going&mdash;" His eyes fell upon his body
and he sank back. "O God! I reckon in hell we'll wear these
clothes."</p>

<p>Hagar stared at him, faint reflecting lines of anxiety and
unhappiness on her brow, quiverings about her lips. "Ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
you to have run away? Was it right to run away?" The
colour flooded her face. It was always hard for her to tell of
her errors, but she felt that she and the boy were in somewhat
the same case, and that she ought to do it. "I did
something my aunt had told me not to do. It was reading a
book that she said was wicked. I can't see yet that it was
wicked. It was very interesting. But the Bishop said that
he didn't christen me for that, and that it was a sin. And
now, for a whole week, grandmother says that I'm not to read
any book at all&mdash;which is very hard. What I mean is," said
Hagar, "though I don't feel yet that there was anything
wicked in that book (I didn't read much of it), I feel perfectly
certain that I ought to obey grandmother. The Bible
tells you so, and I believe in the Bible." Her brow puckered
again. "At least, I believe that I believe in the Bible. And if
there wasn't anybody in the house, and the most interesting
books were lying around, I wouldn't&mdash;at least I think I
wouldn't&mdash;touch one till the week is over." She tried earnestly
to explain her position. "I mean that if I really did
wrong&mdash;and I reckon I'll have to say that I oughtn't to
have disobeyed Aunt Serena, though the Bible doesn't say
anything about aunts&mdash;I'll take the hard things that come
after. Of course"&mdash;she ended politely&mdash;"your folks may
have been mistaken, and you may not have done anything
wrong at all&mdash;"</p>

<p>The boy bloomed at her. "I'll tell you what I did. I live
'way out in the mountains, the other end of nowhere. Well,
Christmas there was a dance in the Cove, and I went, but
Nancy Horn, that had promised to go with me, broke her
word and went with Dave Windless. There was a lot of apple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
jack around, and I took more'n I usually take. And then,
when we were dancing the reel, somebody&mdash;and I'll swear
still it was Dave, though he swore in the court-room it
wasn't&mdash;Dave Windless put out his foot and tripped me
up! Well, Nancy, she laughed.... I don't remember anything
clear after that, and I thought that the man who was
shooting up the room was some other person, though I did
think it was funny the pistol was in my hand.... Anyhow,
Dave got a ball through his hip, and old Daddy Jake Willy,
that I was awful fond of and wouldn't have hurt not for a
still of my own and the best horse on the mountain, he got
his bow arm broken, and one of the women was frightened
into fits, and next week when her baby was born and had a
harelip she said I'd done it.... Anyhow the sheriff came and
took me&mdash;it was about dawn, 'way up on the mountain-side,
and I still thought it was another man going away toward
Catamount Gap and the next county where there wasn't any
Nancy Horn&mdash;I thought so clear till I fired at the sheriff
and broke his elbow and the deputy came up behind and
twisted the pistol away, and somebody else threw a gourd of
water from the spring over me ... and I come to and found
it had been me all the time.... That's what I did, and I got
four years."</p>

<p>"Four years?" said Hagar. "Four years in&mdash;in jail?"</p>

<p>"In the penitentiary," said the boy. "It's a worse word
than jail.... I know what's right and wrong. Liquor's
wrong, and the Judge said carrying concealed weapons was
wrong, and I reckon it is, though there isn't much concealment
when everybody knows you're wearing them.... Yes,
liquor's wrong, and quarrels might go off just with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
words and using your fists if powder and shot weren't right
under your hand, tempting you. Yes, drinking's wrong and
quarreling's wrong, and after I come to my senses it didn't
need no preacher like those that come round Sundays to tell
me that. But I tell you what's the whole floor space of hell
wronger than most of the things men do and that's the
place the lawyers and the judges and the juries send men to!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean that they oughtn't to&mdash;to do anything to
you? You <i>did</i> do wrong."</p>

<p>"No, I don't mean that," said the boy. "I've got good
sense. If I didn't see it at first, old Daddy Jake Willy came
to the county jail three or four times, and he made me see it.
The Judge and the lawyer couldn't ha' made me see it, but
<i>he</i> did. And at last I was willing to go." His face worked.
"The day before I was to go I was in that cell I'd stayed in
then two months and I looked right out into the sunshine.
You could see Old Rocky Knob between two bars, and Bear's
Den between two, and Lonely River running down into the
valley between the other two, and the sun shining over everything&mdash;shining
just like it's shining to-day. Well, I stood
there, looking out, and made a good resolution. I was going
to take what was coming to me because I deserved it, having
broken the peace and lamed men and hurt a woman, and
broken Daddy Jake's arm and fired at the sheriff. I hadn't
meant to do all that, but still I had done it. So I said, 'I'll
take it. And I won't give any trouble. And I'll keep the
rules. If it's a place to make men better in, I'll come out a
better man. I'll work just as hard as any man, and if there's
books to study I'll study, and I'll keep the rules and try to
help other people, and when I come out, I'll be young still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and a better man.'" He rose to his full height in the thicket,
the upper half of his striped body showing like a swimmer's
above the matted green. He sent out his young arms in a
wide gesture at once mocking and despairing, but whether
addressed to earth or heaven was not apparent. "You see,
I didn't know any more about that place than a baby
unborn!"</p>

<p>With that he dropped like a stone back into the thicket and
lay dumb and close, with agonized eyes. Around the base of
the ridge out of the wood came the dogs; behind them three
men with guns.</p>

<p>...One of the men was a jolly, fatherly kind of person.
He tried to explain to Hagar that they weren't really going
to hurt the convict at all&mdash;she saw for herself that the dogs
hadn't hurt him, not a mite! The handcuffs didn't hurt
him either&mdash;they were loose and comfortable. No; they
weren't going to do anything to him, they were just going to
take him back.&mdash;He hadn't hurt her, had he? hadn't said
anything disagreeable to her or done anything but eat up her
tea-party?&mdash;Then that was all right, and the fatherly person
would go himself with her to the house and tell the Colonel
about it. Of course he knew the Colonel, everybody knew
the Colonel! And "Stop crying, little lady! That boy ain't
worth it."</p>

<p>The Colonel's dictum was that the country was getting so
damned unsettled that Hagar must not again be let to play
on the ridge alone.</p>

<p>Old Miss, who had had that morning a somewhat longish
talk with Dr. Bude, stated that she would tell Mary Green
to send for Thomasine and Maggie and Corker. "Dr. Bude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
thinks the child broods too much, and it may be better to
have healthy diversion for her in case&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In case&mdash;!" exclaimed Miss Serena. "Does he really
think, mother, that it's serious?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he knows," answered her mother. "I
don't think it is, myself. But Maria was never like anybody
else&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear Maria!" said Mrs. LeGrand. "She should have
made such a brilliant, lovely woman! If only there was a
little more compliance, more feminine sweetness, more&mdash;if
I may say so&mdash;unselfishness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where," asked the Bishop, "is Medway?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashendyne's needles clicked. "My son was in Spain,
the last we heard: studying the painter Murillo."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

MARIA</h2>


<p>Thomasine and Maggie and Corker arrived and filled the
overseer's house with noise. They were a blatantly healthful,
boisterous set, only Thomasine showing gleams of quiet.
They wanted at once to play on the ridge, but now Hagar
wouldn't play on the ridge. She said she didn't like it any
more. As she spoke, her thin shoulders drew together, and
her eyes also, and two vertical lines appeared between these.
"What you shakin' for?" asked Corker. "Got a chill?"</p>

<p>So they played down by the branch where the willows
grew, or in the old, disused tobacco-house, or in the orchard,
or about a haystack on a hillside. Corker wanted always to
play robbers or going to sea. Maggie liked to jump from the
haystack or to swing, swing, swing, holding to the long, pendant
green withes of the weeping willow, or to climb the apple
trees. Thomasine liked to make dams across the streamlet
below the tobacco-house. She liked to shape wet clay, and
she saved every pebble or bit of bright china, or broken blue
or green glass with which to decorate a small grotto they
were making. She also liked to play ring-around-a-rosy, and
to hunt for four-leaved clovers. Hagar liked to play going to
sea, but she did not care for robbers. She liked to swing from
the willows and to climb a particular apple tree which she
loved, but she did not want to jump from the haystack, nor to
climb all trees. She liked almost everything that Thomasine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
liked, but she was not so terribly fond of ring-around-a-rosy.
In her own likings she found herself somewhat lonely.
None of the three, though Thomasine more than the others,
cared much for a book. They would rather have a sugar-cake
any day. When it came to lying on the hillside without speaking
and watching the clouds and the tree-tops, they did not
care for that at all. However, when they were tired, and
everything else failed, they did like Hagar to tell them a
story. "Aladdin" they liked&mdash;sitting in the shadow of the
haystack, their chins on their hands, Thomasine's eyes still
unconsciously alert for four-leaved clovers, Corker with a
June apple, trying to determine whether he would bite into
it now or wait until Aladdin's mother had uncovered the
jewels before the Sultan. They liked "Aladdin" and "Queen
Gulnare and Prince Beder" and "Snow White and Rose
Red."</p>

<p>And then came the day that they went after raspberries.
That morning Hagar, turning the doorknob of her mother's
room, found the door softly opened from within and Ph&oelig;be
on the threshold. Ph&oelig;be came out, closing the door gently
behind her, beckoned to Hagar, and the two crossed the hall
to the deep window. "I wouldn't go in this mahnin' ef I
were you, honey," said Ph&oelig;be. "Miss Maria done hab a bad
night. She couldn't sleep an' her heart mos' give out. Oh,
hit's all right now, an' she's been lyin' still an' peaceful
since de dawn come up. But we wants her to sleep an' we
don' want her to talk. An' Old Miss thinks an' Ph&oelig;be thinks
too, honey, dat you'd better not go in this mahnin'. Nex'
time Old Miss 'll let you stay twice as long to make up
for it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Hagar looked at her large-eyed, "Is my mother going to
die, Aunt Ph&oelig;be?"</p>

<p>But old Ph&oelig;be put her arms around her and the wrinkles
came out all over her brown face as they did when she laughed.
Ph&oelig;be was a good woman, wise and old and tender and a
strong liar. "Law, no, chile&mdash;What put dat notion in yo' po'
little haid? No, indeedy! We gwine pull Miss Maria through,
jes' as easy! Dr. Bude he say he gwine do hit, and what Dr.
Bude say goes for sho! Ph&oelig;be done see him raise de mos'
dead. Law, no, don' you worry 'bout Miss Maria! An' de
nex' time you goes in de room, you kin stay jes' ez long ez
you like. You kin sit by her er whole hour an' won't nobody
say you nay."</p>

<p>Downstairs Captain Bob was sitting on the sunny step of
the sunny back porch, getting a thorn out of Luna's paw.
"Hi, Gipsy," he said, when Hagar came and stood by him;
"what's the matter with breakfast this morning?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Hagar. "I haven't seen grandmother
to-day. Uncle Bob&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, chicken?"</p>

<p>"They'd tell you, wouldn't they, if my mother was going
to die?"</p>

<p>Captain Bob, having relieved Luna of the thorn, gave his
attention fully to his great-niece. He was slow and kindly
and unexacting and incurious and unimaginative, and the
unusual never occurred to him before it happened. "Maria
going to die? That's damned nonsense, partridge! Haven't
heard a breath of it&mdash;isn't anything to hear. Nobody dies
at Gilead Balm&mdash;hasn't been a death here since the War.
Besides, Medway's away.&mdash;Mustn't get notions in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
head&mdash;makes you unhappy, and things go on just the
same as ever." He pulled her down on the step beside him.
"Look at Luna, now! She ain't notionate&mdash;are you,
Luna? Luna and I are going over the hills this morning to
find Old Miss's guineas for her. Don't you want to go
along?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe I do, thank you, Uncle Bob."</p>

<p>Mrs. LeGrand came out upon the porch, fresh and charming
in a figured dimity with a blue ribbon. "Mrs. Ashendyne
and Serena are talking to Dr. Bude, and as you men must be
famished, Captain Bob, I am going to ring for breakfast and
pour out your coffee for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>In the hall Hagar appealed to her. "Mrs. LeGrand, can't
I go into grandmother's room and hear what Dr. Bude says
about my mother?" But Mrs. LeGrand smiled and shook her
head and laid hands on her. "No, indeed, dear child! Your
mother's all right. You come with me, and have your breakfast."</p>

<p>The Bishop appearing at the stair foot, she turned to greet
him. Hagar, slipping from her touch, stole down the hall to
Old Miss's chamber and tried the door. It gave and let her
in. Old Miss was seated in the big chair, Dr. Bude and the
Colonel were standing on either side of the hearth, and Miss
Serena was between them and the door.</p>

<p>"Hagar!" exclaimed Miss Serena. "Don't come in now,
dear. Grandmother and I will be out to breakfast in a
moment."</p>

<p>But Hagar had the courage of unhappiness and groping and
fear for the most loved. She fled straight to Dr. Bude. "Dr.
Bude&mdash;oh, Dr. Bude&mdash;is my mother going to die?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Bude," said the Colonel from the other side of the
hearth.</p>

<p>Dr. Bude, an able country doctor, loved and honoured,
devoted and fatherly and wise, made a "Tchk!" with his
tongue against the roof of his mouth.</p>

<p>Old Miss, leaving the big chair, came and took Hagar and
drew her back with her into the deep chintz hollows. No one
might doubt that Old Miss loved her granddaughter. Now
her clasp was as stately as ever, but her voice was quite gentle,
though of course authoritative&mdash;else it could not have
belonged to Old Miss. "Your mother had a bad night, dear,
and so, to make her quiet and comfortable, we sent early for
Dr. Bude. She is going to sleep now, and to-morrow you shall
go in and see her. But you can only go if you are a good, obedient
child. Yes, I am telling you the truth. I think Maria will
get well. I have never thought anything else.&mdash;Now, run
away and get your breakfast, and to-day you and Thomasine
and Maggie and Corker shall go raspberrying."</p>

<p>Dr. Bude spoke from the braided rug. "No one knows,
Hagar, what's going to happen in this old world, do they?
But Nature has a way of taking care of people quite regardless
and without waiting to consult the doctors. I've
watched Nature right closely, and I never give up anything.
Your mother's right ill, my dear, but so have a lot
of other people been right ill and gotten well. You go pick
your raspberries, and maybe to-morrow you can see her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can't I see her to-night?"</p>

<p>"Well, maybe&mdash;maybe&mdash;" said the doctor.</p>

<p>The raspberry patches were almost two miles away, past a
number of shaggy hills and dales. A wood road led that way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and Hagar and Thomasine and Maggie and Corker, with
Jinnie, a coloured woman, to take care of them, felt the damp
leaf mould under their feet. A breeze, coming through oak
and pine, tossed their hair and fluttered the girls' skirts and
the broad collar of Corker's voluminous shirt. The sky was
bright blue, with two or three large clouds like sailing vessels
with all sail on. A cat-bird sang to split its throat. They saw
a black snake, and a rabbit showed a white tip of tail, and a
lightning-blasted pine with a large empty bird-nest in the
topmost crotch, ineffably lonely and deserted against the
deep sky, engaged their attention. They had various adventures.
Each of the children carried a tin bucket for berries,
and Jinnie carried a white-oak split basket with dinner in it&mdash;sandwiches
and rusks and a jar with milk and snowball
cakes. They were going to stay all day. That was what usually
they loved. It was so adventurous.</p>

<p>Corker strode along whistling. Maggie whistled, too, as
well as a boy, though he looked disdain at her and said,
"Huh! Girls can't whistle!"</p>

<p>"Dar's a piece of poetry I done heard," said Jinnie,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"'Er whistlin' woman an' er crowin' hen,<br />
Dey ain' gwine come ter no good end.'"<br />
</div>

<p>Thomasine hummed as she walked. She had filled her
bucket with various matters as she went along, and now she
was engaged in fashioning out of the green burrs of the burdock
a basket with an elaborate handle. "Don't you want
some burrs?" she asked Hagar, walking beside her. Thomasine
was always considerate and would give away almost
anything she had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Hagar took the burrs and began also to make a basket.
She was being good. And, indeed, as the moments passed,
the heavy, painful feeling about her heart went away. The
doctor had said and grandmother had said, and Uncle Bob
and Ph&oelig;be and every one.... The raspberries. She instantly
visualized one of the blue willow saucers filled with
raspberries, carried in by herself to her mother, at supper-time.
Yarrow was in bloom and Black-eyed Susans and the
tall white Jerusalem candles. Coming back she would gather
a big bouquet for the grey jar on her mother's table. She
grew light-hearted. A bronze butterfly fluttered before her,
the heavy odour of the pine filled her nostrils, the sky was so
blue, the air so sweet&mdash;there was a pearly cloud like a castle
and another like a little boat&mdash;a little boat. Off went
her fancy, lizard-quick, feather-light.</p>

<div class="poem">
"Swing low, sweet chariot&mdash;"<br />
</div>

<p>sang Jinnie as she walked.</p>

<p>The raspberry patches were in sunny hollows. There was
a span-wide stream, running pure over a gravel bed, and a
grazed-over hillside, green and short-piled as velvet, and deep
woods closing in, shutting out. Summer sunshine bathed
every grass blade and berry leaf, summer winds cooled the
air, bees and grasshoppers and birds, squirrels in the woods,
rippling water, wind in the leaves made summer sounds. It
was a happy day. Sometimes Hagar, Thomasine, Maggie,
Corker, and Jinnie picked purply-red berries from the same
bush; sometimes they scattered and combined in twos and
threes. Sometimes each established a corner and picked in an
elfin solitude. Sometimes they conversed or bubbled over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
with laughter, sometimes they kept a serious silence. It was
a matter of rivalry as to whose bucket should first be filled.
Hagar strayed off at last to an angle of an old rail fence. The
berries, as she found, were very fine here. She called the news
to the others, but they said they had fine bushes, too, and so
she picked on with a world of her own about her. The June-bugs
droned and droned, her fingers moved slower and slower.
At last she stopped picking, and, lying down on a sunken
rock by the fence, fell to dreaming. Her dreams were already
shot with thought, and she was apt, when she seemed
most idle, to be silently, inwardly growing. Now she was
thinking about Heaven and about God. She was a great committer
of poetry to memory, and now, while she lay filtering
sand through her hands as through an hourglass, she said
over a stanza hard to learn, which yet she had learned some
days ago.</p>

<div class="poem">
"Trailing clouds of glory do we come<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From God, who is our home&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<p>When she had repeated it dreamily, in an inward whisper, the
problem of why, in that case, she was so far from home engaged
her attention. The "here" and the "there&mdash;" God
away, away off on a throne with angels, and Hagar Ashendyne,
in a blue sunbonnet here by a Virginia rail fence, with
raspberry stain on her hands. <i>Home</i> was where you lived.
God was everywhere; then, was God right here, too? But
Hagar Ashendyne couldn't see the throne and the gold steps
and floor and the angels. She could make a picture of them,
just as she could of Solomon's throne, or Pharaoh's throne, or
Queen Victoria's throne, but the picture didn't stir anything
at her heart. She wasn't homesick for the court. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
homesick to be a good woman when she grew up, and to learn
all the time and to know beautiful things, but she wasn't
homesick for Heaven where God lived. Then was she wicked?
Hagar wondered and wondered. The yellow sand dropped
from between her palms.... God in the sand, God in me,
God here and now.... Then God also is trying to grow
more God.... Hagar drew a great sigh, and for the moment
gave it up.</p>

<p>Before her on the grey rail was a slender, burnished insect,
all gold-and-green armour. Around the lock of the fence
came, like a gold-and-green moving stiletto, a lizard which
took and devoured the gold-and-green insect.... God in
the lizard, God in the insect, God devouring God, making
Himself feed Himself, growing so.... The sun suddenly left
the grass and the raspberry bushes. A cloud had hidden it.
Other cloud masses, here pearly white, here somewhat dark,
were boiling up from the horizon.</p>

<p>Jinnie called the children together. "What we gwine do?
Look like er storm. Reckon we better light out fer home!"</p>

<p>Protests arose. "Ho!" cried Corker, "it ain't going to be a
storm. I haven't got my bucket more'n half full and we
haven't had a picnic neither! Let's stay!"</p>

<p>"Let's stay," echoed Maggie. "Who's afraid of a little bit
of storm anyhow?"</p>

<p>"It's lots better for it to catch us here in the open," argued
Thomasine. "They're all tall trees in the wood. But <i>I</i> think
the clouds are getting smaller&mdash;there's the sun again!"</p>

<p>The sunshine fell, strong and golden. "We's gwine stay
den," said Jinnie. "But ef hit rains an' you all gets wet an'
teks cold, I's gwine tell Old Miss I jus' couldn't mek you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
come erway!&mdash;Dar's de old cow-house at de end of de field.
I reckon we kin refugee dar ef de worst comes to de worst."</p>

<p>While they were eating the snowball cakes, a large cloud
came up and determinedly covered the sun. By the time
they had eaten the last crumb, lightnings were playing.
"Dar now, I done tol' you!" cried Jinnie. "I never see such
children anyhow! Old Miss an' Mrs. Green jus' ought-ter
whip you all! Now you gwine git soppin' wet an' maybe de
lightning'll strike you, too!"</p>

<p>"No, it won't!" cried Corker. "The cow-house's my castle,
an' we've been robbing a freight train an' the constable an'
old Captain Towney and the army are after us&mdash;I'm going
to get to the cow-house first!"</p>

<p>Maggie scrambled to her feet. "No, you ain't! I'm going
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>The cow-house was dark and somewhat dirty, but they
found a tolerable square yard or two of earthen floor and
they all sat close together for warmth&mdash;the air having
grown quite cold&mdash;and for company, a thunderstorm,
after all, being a thing that made even train robbers and
castled barons feel rather small and helpless. For an hour
lightnings flashed and thunders rolled and the rain fell in
leaden lines. Then the lightnings grew less frequent and
vivid, and the thunder travelled farther away, but the rain
still fell. "Oh, it's so stupid and dark in here!" said Corker.
"Let's tell stories. Hagar, you tell a story, and Jinnie, you
tell a story!"</p>

<p>Hagar told about the Snow Queen and Kay and Gerda, and
they liked that very well. All the cow-house was dark as the
little robber girl's hut in the night-time when all were asleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
save Gerda and the little robber girl and the reindeer. When
they came to the reindeer, Corker said he heard him moving
behind them in a corner, and Maggie said she heard him, too,
and Jinnie called out, "Whoa, dere, Mr. Reindeer! You des
er stay still till we's ready fer you!"&mdash;and they all drew
closer together with a shudder of delight.</p>

<p>The clouds were breaking&mdash;the lines of rain were silver
instead of leaden. Even the cow-house was lighter inside.
There was no reindeer, after all; there were only brown logs
and trampled earth and mud-daubers' nests and a big spider's
web. "Now, Jinnie," said Corker, "you tell a ghost story."</p>

<p>Thomasine objected. "I don't like ghost stories. Hagar
doesn't either."</p>

<p>"I don't mind them much," said Hagar. "I don't have to
believe them."</p>

<p>But Jinnie chose to become indignant. "You jes' hab to
believe dem. Dey're true! My lan'! Goin' ter church an'
readin' de Bible an' den doubtin' erbout ghosts! I'se gwine
tell you er story you's got ter believe, 'cause hit's done happen!
Hit's gwine ter scare you, too! Dey tell me hit scare
a young girl down in de Hollow inter fits. Hit's gwine ter
mek yo' flesh crawl. Sayin' ghos' stories ain't true, when
everybody knows dey's true!"</p>

<p>The piece of ancient African imagination, traveller of ten
thousand years through heated forests, was fearsome enough.
"Ugh!" said the children and shivered and stared.&mdash;It took
the sun, indeed, to drive the creeping, mistlike thoughts
away.</p>

<p>Going home through the rain-soaked woodland, Hagar began
to gather flowers. Her bucket of berries on her arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
she stepped aside for this bloom and that, gathering with
long stems, making a sheaf of blossoms. "What you doin'
dat for?" queried Jinnie. "Dey's all wet. You'll jes' ruin
dat gingham dress!" But Hagar kept on plucking Black-eyed
Susans, and cardinal flowers, and purple clover and
lady's-lace.</p>

<p>They came, in the afternoon glow, in sight of Gilead Balm.
They came closer until the house was large, standing between
its dark, funereal cedars, with a rosy cloud behind.</p>

<p>"All the blinds are closed as though we'd gone away!"
said Hagar. "I never saw it that way before."</p>

<p>Mrs. Green was at the lower gate, waiting for them. Her
old, kind, wrinkled face was pale between the slats of her
sunbonnet, but her eyelids were reddened as though she had
been weeping. "Yes, yes, children, I'm glad you got a lot of
berries!&mdash;Corker and Maggie and Thomasine, you go with
Jinnie. Mind me and go.&mdash;Hagar, child, you and me are
goin' to come on behind.... You and me are goin' to sit
here a bit on the summer-house step.... The Colonel said
I was the best one after all to do it, and I'm going to do it,
but I'd rather take a killing! ... Yes, sit right here, with
my arm about you. Hagar, child, I've got something to tell
you, honey."</p>

<p>Hagar looked at her with large, dark eyes. "Mrs. Green,
why are all the shutters closed?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

EGLANTINE</h2>


<p>No one could be so cross-grained as to deny that Eglantine
was a sweet place. It lay sweetly on just the right, softly
swelling hill. The old grey-stucco main house had a sweet
porch, with wistaria growing sweetly over it; the long, added
grey-stucco wings had pink and white roses growing sweetly
on trellises between the windows. There were silver maples
and heavily blooming locust trees and three fine magnolias.
There were thickets of weigelia and spiræa and forsythia, and
winding walks, and an arbour, and the whole twenty acres or
so was enclosed by a thorny, osage-orange hedge, almost,
though not quite so high as the hedge around the Sleeping
Beauty's palace. It was a sweet place. Everyone said so&mdash;parents
and guardians, the town that neighboured Eglantine,
tourists that drove by, visitors to the Commencement exercises&mdash;everybody!
The girls themselves said so. It was
praised of all&mdash;almost all. The place was sweet. M. Morel,
the French teacher, who was always improving his English,
and so on the hunt for synonyms, once said in company that
it was saccharine.</p>

<p>Miss Carlisle, who taught ancient and modern history and,
in the interstices, astronomy and a blue-penciled physiology,
gently corrected him. "Oh, M. Morel! We never use that
word in this sense! If you wish to vary the term you might
use 'charming,' or 'refined,' or 'elegant.' Besides"&mdash;she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
gazed across the lawn&mdash;"it isn't so sweet, I always think,
in November as it is in April or May."</p>

<p>"The sweetest time, I think," said Miss Bedford, who
taught mathematics, geography, and Latin, "is when the
lilac is in bloom."</p>

<p>"And when the robins nest again," sighed a pensive, widowed
Mrs. Lane, who taught the little girls.</p>

<p>"It is 'refined' always," said M. Morel. "November or
April, what is ze difference? It has ze atmosphere. It is
sugary."</p>

<p>"Here," remarked Miss Gage, who taught philosophy&mdash;"here
is Mrs. LeGrand."</p>

<p>All rose to greet the mistress of Eglantine as she came out
from the hall upon the broad porch. Mrs. LeGrand's graciously
ample form was wrapped in black cashmere and black
lace. Her face was unwrinkled, but her hair had rapidly
whitened. It was piled upon her head after an agreeable
fashion and crowned by a graceful small cap of lace. She was
ample and creamy and refinedly despotic. With her came
her god-daughter, Sylvie Maine. It was early November,
and the sycamores were yet bronze, the maples aflame. It
was late Friday afternoon, and the occasion the arrival and
entertainment overnight of an English writer of note, a
woman visiting America with a book in mind.</p>

<p>Mrs. LeGrand said that she had thought she heard the carriage
wheels. Mr. Pollock, the music-master, said, No; it
was the wind down the avenue. Mrs. LeGrand, pleasantly,
just condescending enough and not too condescending,
glanced from one to the other of the group. "M. Morel and
Mr. Pollock and you, Miss Carlisle and Miss Bedford, will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
I hope, take supper with our guest and me? Sylvie, here, will
keep her usual place. I can't do without Sylvie. She spoils
me and I spoil her! And we will have besides, I think, the
girl that has stood highest this month in her classes. Who
will it be, Miss Gage?"</p>

<p>"Hagar Ashendyne, Mrs. LeGrand."</p>

<p>Mrs. LeGrand had a humorous smile. "Then, Sylvie, see
that Hagar's dress is all right and try to get her to do her
hair differently. I like Eglantine girls to look their birth and
place."</p>

<p>"Dear Cousin Olivia," said Sylvie, who was extremely
pretty, "for all her plainness, Hagar's got distinction."</p>

<p>But Mrs. LeGrand shrugged her shoulders. She couldn't
see it. A little wind arising, all the place became a whirl of
coloured leaves. And now the carriage wheels were surely
heard.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Sylvie went up to Hagar's room. It was
what was called the "tower room"&mdash;small and high up&mdash;too
small for anything but a single bed and one inmate. It
wasn't a popular room with the Eglantine girls&mdash;a room
without a roommate was bad enough, and then, when it was
upon another floor, quite away from every one&mdash;! Language
failed. But Hagar Ashendyne liked it, and it had been hers
for three years. She had been at Eglantine for three years,
going home to Gilead Balm each summer. She was eighteen&mdash;old
for her age, and young for her age.</p>

<p>Sylvie found her curled in the window-seat, and spoke
twice before she made her hear. "Hagar! come back to
earth!"</p>

<p>Hagar unfolded her long limbs and pushed her hair away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
from her eyes. "I was travelling," she said. "I was crossing
the Desert of Sahara with a caravan."</p>

<p>"You are," remarked Sylvie, "too funny for words!&mdash;You
and I are to take supper with 'Roger Michael'!"</p>

<p>A red came into Hagar's cheek. "Are we? Did Mrs. LeGrand
say so?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hagar lit the lamp. "'Roger Michael'&mdash;'Roger Michael'&mdash;Sylvie,
wouldn't you rather use your own name if you
wrote?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know!" answered Sylvie vaguely. "What
dress are you going to wear?"</p>

<p>"I haven't any but the green."</p>

<p>"Then wear your deep lace collar with it. Cousin Olivia
wants you to look as nice as possible. Don't you want me to
do your hair?"</p>

<p>Hagar placed the lamp upon the wooden slab of a small,
old-time dressing-table. That done, she stood and looked
at herself with a curious, wistful puckering of the lips.
"Sylvie, prinking and fixing up doesn't suit me."</p>

<p>"Don't you like people to like you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. I like it so much it must be a sin. Only not
very many people do.... And I don't think prinking
helps."</p>

<p>"Yes, it does. If you look pretty, how can people help
liking you? It's three fourths the battle."</p>

<p>Hagar fell to considering it. "Is it?... But then we don't
all think the same thing pretty or ugly." The red showed
again like wine beneath her smooth, dark skin, "Sylvie, I'd
<i>like</i> to be beautiful. I'd like to be as beautiful as Beatrix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Esmond. I'd like to be as beautiful as Helen of Troy. But
everybody at Eglantine thinks I am ugly, and I suppose I
am." She looked wistfully at Sylvie.</p>

<p>Now in the back of Sylvie's head there was certainly the
thought that Hagar ought to have said, "I'd like to be as
beautiful as you, Sylvie." But Sylvie had a sweet temper
and she was not unmagnanimous. "I shouldn't call you
ugly," she said judicially. "You aren't pretty, and I don't
believe any one would ever call you so, but you aren't at
all disagreeably plain. You've got something that makes
people ask who you are. I wouldn't worry."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wasn't worrying!" said Hagar. "I was only <i>preferring</i>.&mdash;I'll
wear the lace collar." She took it out of a
black Japanned box, and with it the topaz brooch that had
been her mother's.</p>

<p>The visitor from England found the large, square Eglantine
parlour an interesting room. The pier-glasses, framed in
sallow gilt, the many-prismed chandelier, the old velvet carpet
strewn with large soft roses, the claw-foot furniture, the
two or three portraits of powdered Colonial gentlemen, the
bits of old china, the framed letters bearing signatures that
seemed to float to her from out her old United States History&mdash;all
came to her like a vague fragrance from some unusual
old garden. And then, curiously superimposed upon
all this, appeared memorials of four catastrophic years.
Soldiers and statesmen of the Confederacy had found no
time in which to have their portraits painted. But Mrs. LeGrand
had much of family piety and, in addition, daguerreotypes
and <i>cartes de visite</i> of the dead and gone. With her first
glow of prosperity she had a local artist paint her father from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a daguerreotype. Stalwart, with a high Roman face, he looked
forth in black broadcloth with a roll of parchment in his
hand. The next year she had had her husband painted in
his grey brigadier's uniform. Her two brothers followed,
and then a famous kinsman&mdash;all dead and gone, all slain in
battle. The portraits were not masterpieces, but there they
were, in the pathos of the grey, underneath each a little gilt
plate. "Killed at Sharpsburg."&mdash;"Killed Leading a Charge
in the Wilderness."&mdash;"Killed at Cold Harbour." Upon the
wall, against the pale, century-old paper, hung crossed swords
and cavalry pistols, and there were framed commissions and
battle orders, and an empty shell propped open the wide
white-panelled door. The English visitor found it all strange
and interesting. It was as though a fragrance of dried rose-leaves
contended with a whiff of gunpowder. The small
dining-room into which presently she was carried had fascinating
prints&mdash;"Pocahontas Baptized," and "Pocahontas
Married," and a group of women with children and several
negroes gathered about an open grave, one woman standing
out, reading the burial service.&mdash;Roger Michael was so interested
that she would have liked not to talk at all, just
to sit and look at the prints and mark the negro servants
passing about the table. But Mrs. LeGrand's agreeable
voice was asking about the health of the Queen&mdash;she bestirred
herself to be an acceptable guest.</p>

<p>The small dining-room was separated only by an archway
from the large dining-room, and into the latter, in orderly
files, came the Eglantine pupils, wound about to their several
tables and seated themselves with demureness. M. Morel
was speaking of the friendship of France and England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Roger Michael, while she appeared to listen, studied these
American girls, these Southern girls. She found many of
them pretty, even lovely,&mdash;not, emphatically, with the English
beauty of skin, not with the colour of New England girls,
among whom, recently, she had been,&mdash;not with the stronger
frame that was coming in with this generation of admission to
out-of-door exercise, the certain boyish alertness and poise
that more and more she was seeing exhibited,&mdash;but pretty or
lovely, with delicacy and a certain languor, a dim sweetness
of expression, and, precious trove in America! voices that
pleased. She noted exceptions to type, small, swarthy girls
and large overgrown ones, girls that were manifestly robust,
girls that were alert, girls that were daring, girls that were
timid or stupid, or simply anæmic, girls that approached the
English type and girls that were at the very antipodes&mdash;but
the general impression was of Farther South than she had as
yet gone in America, of more grace and slowness, manner
and sweetness. Their clothes interested her; they were so
much more "dressed" than they would have been in England.
Evidently, in deference to the smaller room, there was to-night
an added control of speech; there sounded no more than
a pleasant hum, a soft, indistinguishable murmur of young
voices.</p>

<p>"They are so excited over the prospect of your speaking
to them after supper," said Mrs. LeGrand, her hand upon
the coffee urn.&mdash;"Cream and sugar?"</p>

<p>"They do not seem excited," thought Roger Michael.&mdash;"Sugar,
thank you; no cream. Of what shall I talk to them?
In what are they especially interested?"</p>

<p>"In your charming books, I should say," answered Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
LeGrand. "In how you write them, and in the authors you
must know. And then your sweet English life&mdash;Stratford
and Canterbury and Devonshire&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We have been reading 'Lorna Doone' aloud this month,"
said Miss Carlisle. "And the girls very cleverly arranged a
little play.... Sylvie here played Lorna beautifully."</p>

<p>Roger Michael smiled across at Hagar, two or three places
down, on the other side of the table. "I should like to have
seen it," she said in her good, deep English voice.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Hagar, "I'm not Sylvie. I played Lizzie."</p>

<p>"This is my little cousin and god-daughter, Sylvie Maine,"
said Mrs. LeGrand. "And this is Hagar Ashendyne, the
granddaughter of an old friend and connection of my family."</p>

<p>"<i>Hagar Ashendyne</i>," said Roger Michael. "I remember
meeting once in the south of France a Southerner&mdash;a Mr.
Medway Ashendyne."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" exclaimed Mrs. LeGrand. "Then you have met
Hagar's father. Medway Ashendyne! He is a great traveller&mdash;we
do not see as much of him as we should like to see, do
we, Hagar?"</p>

<p>"I have not seen him," said Hagar, "since I was a little
girl."</p>

<p>Her voice, though low, was strange and vibrant. "What's
here?" thought Roger Michael, but what she said was only,
"He was a very pleasant gentleman, very handsome, very
cultivated. My friends and I were thrown with him during
a day at Carcassonne. A month afterwards we met him at
Aigues-Mortes. He was sketching&mdash;quite wonderfully."</p>

<p>Mrs. LeGrand inwardly deplored Medway Ashendyne's
daughter's lack of <i>savoir-faire</i>. "To give herself away like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
that! Just the kind of thing her mother used to do!" Aloud
she said, "Medway's a great wanderer, but one of these days
he will come home and settle down and we'll all be happy together.
I remember him as a young man&mdash;a perfectly fascinating
young man.&mdash;Dinah, bring more waffles!&mdash;Yes, if
you will tell our girls something of your charming English
life. We are all so interested&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Carlisle's voice came in, a sweet treble like a canary's.
"The Princess of Wales keeps her beauty, does she not?"</p>

<p>The study hall was a long, red room, well enough lighted,
with a dais holding desk and chairs. Roger Michael, seated
in one of these, watched, while her hostess made a little
speech of introduction, the bright parterre of young faces.
Sitting so, she excercised a discrimination that had not
been possible in the dining-room. Of the faces before her
each was different, after all, from the other. There were keen
faces as well as languorous ones; brows that promised as well
as those that did not; behind the prevailing "sweet" expression,
something sometimes that showed as by heat lightning,
something that had depth. "Here as elsewhere," thought
Roger Michael. "The same life!"</p>

<p>Mrs. LeGrand was closing, was turning toward her. She
rose, bowed toward the mistress of Eglantine, then, standing
square, with her good, English figure and her sensibly shod,
English feet, she began to talk to these girls.</p>

<p>She did not, however, speak to them as, even after she rose,
she meant to speak. She did not talk letters in England, nor
English landscape. She spoke quite differently. She spoke
of industrial and social unrest, of conditions among the toilers
of the world. "I am what is called a Fabian," she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and went on as though that explained. She spoke of certain
movements in thought, of breakings-away toward larger
horizons. She spoke of various heresies, political, social, and
other. "Of course I don't call them heresies; I call them 'the
enlarging vision.'" She gave instances, incidents; she spoke
of the dawn coming over the mountains, and of the trumpet
call of "the coming time." She said that the dying nineteenth
century heard the stronger voice of the twentieth century,
and that it was a voice with a great promise. She spoke of
women, of the rapidly changing status of women, of what
machinery had done for women, of what education had done.
She spoke of the great needs of women, of their learning to
organize, of the need for unity among women. She used the
words "false position" thrice. "Woman's immemorially
false position."&mdash;"Society has so falsely placed her."&mdash;"Until
what is false is done away with."&mdash;She said that
women were beginning to see. She said that the next quarter-century
would witness a revolution. "You young people before
me will see it; some of you will take part in it. I congratulate
you on living when you will live." She talked for nearly
an hour, and just as she was closing it came to her, with a certain
effect of startling, that much of the time she had been
speaking to just one countenance there. She was speaking
directly to the girl called Hagar Ashendyne, sitting halfway
down the hall. When she took her seat there followed a
deep little moment of silence broken at last by applause.
Roger Michael marked the girl in green. She didn't applaud;
she sat looking very far away. Mrs. LeGrand was saying
something smoothly perfunctory, beflowered with personal
compliments; the girls all stood; the Eglantine hostess and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
guest, with the teachers who had been at table, passed from
the platform, and turned, after a space of hallway, into the
rose-carpeted big parlour.</p>

<p>Miss Carlisle and Miss Bedford brought up the rear.
"Didn't you think," murmured the latter, "that that was a
very curious speech? Now and then I felt so uneasy.&mdash;It was
as though in a moment she was going to say something indelicate!
Dear Mrs. LeGrand ought to have told her how careful
we are with our girls."</p>

<p>The wind rose that night and swept around the tower
room, and then, between eleven and twelve, died away and
left a calm that by contrast was achingly still. Hagar was not
yet asleep. She lay straight and still in the narrow bed, her
arms behind her head. She was rarely in a hurry to go to
sleep. This hour and a half was her dreaming-awake time,
her time for romance building, her time for floating here and
there, as in a Witch of Atlas boat in her own No-woman's
land. She had in the stalls of her mind half a dozen vague and
floating romances, silver and tenuous as mist; one night she
drove one afield, another night another. All took place in a
kind of other space, in countries that were not on any map.
She brought imagined physical features into a strange juxtaposition.
When the Himalayas haunted her she ranged them,
snow-clad, by a West Indian sea. Ætna and Chimborazo rose
over against each other, and a favourite haunt was a palm-fringed,
flower-starred lawn reached only through crashing
leagues of icebergs. She took over localities that other
minds had made; when she wished to she pushed aside a curtain
of vine and entered the Forest of Arden; she knew how
the moonlight fell in the wood outside Athens; she entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the pilotless boat and drove toward the sunset gate of the
Domain of Arnheim. Usually speaking, people out of books
made the population of these places, and here, too, there were
strange juxtapositions. She looped and folded Time like a
ribbon. Mark Antony and Robin Hood were contemporaries;
Pericles and Philip Sidney; Ruth and Naomi came up abreast,
with Joan of Arc, and all three with Grace Darling; the
Round Table and the Girondins were acquainted. All manner
of historic and fictive folk wandered in the glades of her
imagination, any kind of rendezvous was possible. Much
went on in that inner world&mdash;doubts and dreams and dim
hypotheses, romance run wild, Fata Morganas, Castles in
Spain, passion for dead shapes, worship of heroes, strange,
dumb stirrings toward self-immolation, dreams of martyrdom,
mind drenched now with this poem, now with that,
dream life, dream adventures, dream princes, religions, world
cataclysms, passionings over a colour, a tone, a line of verse&mdash;much
utter spring and burgeoning. Eighteen years&mdash;a fluid
unimprisoned mind&mdash;and no confidante but herself; of
how recapitulatory were these hours, of how youth of
all the ages surged, pulsed, vibrated through her slender
frame, she had, of course, no adequate notion. She would
simply have said that she couldn't sleep, and that she liked
to tell herself stories. As she lay here now, she was not
thinking of Roger Michael's talk, though she had thought of
it for the first twenty minutes after she had put out the
lamp. It had been very interesting, and it had stirred her
while it was in the saying, but the grappling hook had not
finally held; she was not ready for it. She had let it slip from
her mind in favour of the rose and purple and deep violin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
humming of one of her romances. She had lain for an hour
in a great wood, like a wood in Xanadu, beneath trees that
touched the sky, and like an elfin stream had gone by
knights and ladies.... The great clock down in the hall
struck twelve. She turned her slender body, and the bed
being pushed against the window, laid her outstretched
hands upon the window-sill, and looked up, between the spectral
sycamore boughs, to where Sirius blazed. Dream wood
and dream shapes took flight. She lay with parted lips, her
mind quiet, her soul awake. Minutes passed; a cloud drove
behind the sycamore branches and hid the star. First blankness
came and then again unrest. She sat up in bed, pushing
her two heavy braids of hair back over her shoulders. The
small clock upon the mantel ticked and ticked. The little
room looked cold in the watery moonlight. Hagar was not
dreaming or imagining now; she was thinking back. She sat
very still for five minutes, tears slowly gathering in her eyes.
At last she turned and lay face down upon the bed, her outstretched
hands against the wooden frame. Her tears wet
the sleeve of her gown. "<i>Carcassonne&mdash;Aigues-Mortes.

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

MR. LAYDON</h2>


<p>The winter was so open, so mild and warm, that a few pale
roses clung to their stems through half of December. Christmas
proved a green Christmas; neither snow nor ice, but soft,
Indian summer weather. Eglantine always gave two weeks'
holiday at Christmas. It was a great place for holidays.
Right and left went the girls. Those whose own homes were
too far away went with roommates or bosom friends to theirs;
hardly a pupil was left to mope in the rooms that grew so still.
Most of the teachers went away. The scattering was general.</p>

<p>But Hagar remained at Eglantine. Gilead Balm was a
good long way off. She had gone home last Christmas and
the Christmas before, but this year&mdash;she hardly knew how&mdash;she
had missed it. In the most recently received of his
rare letters her grandfather had explicitly stated that, though
he was prepared to pay for her schooling and to support her
until she married, she must, on her side, get along with as
little money as possible. It was criminal that he had so
little nowadays, but such was the melancholy fact. The
whole world was going to the dogs. He sometimes felt a
cold doubt as to whether he could hold Gilead Balm. He
wished to die there, at any rate. Hagar had been very
unhappy over that letter, and it set her to wondering
more strongly than ever about money, and to longing to
make it. In her return letters he suggested that she stay at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Eglantine this Christmas, and so save travelling expenses.
And in order that Gilead Balm might not feel that she would
be too dreadfully disappointed, she said that it was very
pleasant at Eglantine, and that several of the girls were
going to stay, and that she would be quite happy and
wouldn't mind it much, though of course she wanted to see
them all at Gilead Balm. The plan was of her suggesting,
but she had not realized that they might fall in with it.
When her grandmother answered at length, explaining losses
that the Colonel had sustained, and agreeing that this year
it might be best for her to stay at Eglantine, she tried not to
feel desperately hurt and despondent. She loved Gilead
Balm, loved it as much as her mother had hated it. Old
Miss's letter had shown her own disappointment, but&mdash;"You
are getting to be a woman and must consider the
family. Ashendyne and Coltsworth women, I am glad to
say, have always known their duty to the family and have
lived up to it." The last half of the letter had a good deal to
say of Ralph Coltsworth who was at the University.</p>

<p>Hagar was here at Eglantine, and it was two days before
Christmas, and most of the girls were gone. Sylvie was gone.
The teacher whom she liked best&mdash;Miss Gage&mdash;was gone.
Mrs. LeGrand, who liked holidays, too, was going. Mrs.
Lane and Miss Bedford and the housekeeper were not
going, and they and the servants would look after Eglantine.
Besides these there would be left the books in the book-room,
and Hagar would have leave to be out of doors, in the winding
walks and beneath the trees, alone and whenever she
pleased. The weather was dreamy still; everywhere a warm
amethyst haze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>This morning had come a box from Gilead Balm. Her
grandmother had filled it with good things to eat and the
Colonel sent his love and a small gold-piece. There was a
pretty belt from Captain Bob and a hand-painted plate and
a soft pink wool, shell-pattern, crocheted "fascinator" from
Miss Serena. Mrs. Green sent a hemstitched handkerchief,
and the servants sent a Christmas card. Through the box
were scattered little sprays from the Gilead Balm cedars,
and there was a bunch of white and red and button chrysanthemums.
Hagar, sitting on the hearth-rug, unpacked
everything; then went off into a brown study, the chrysanthemums
in her lap.</p>

<p>Later in the morning she arranged upon the hand-painted
plate some pieces of home-made candy, several slices of fruitcake,
three or four lady apples, and a number of Old Miss's
exquisitely thin and crisp wafers, and with it in her hand
went downstairs to Mrs. LeGrand's room, knocked at the
door, and was bidden to enter. Mrs. LeGrand half-raised
herself from a flowery couch near the fire, put the novel
that she was reading behind her pillow, and stretched out
her hand. "Ah, Hagar!&mdash;Goodies from Gilead Balm? How
nice! Thank you, my dear!" She took a piece of cocoanut
candy, then waved the hand-painted plate to the round
table. "Put it there, dear child! Now sit down for a minute
and keep me company."</p>

<p>Hagar took the straight chair on the other side of the
hearth. The bright, leaping flame was between the two. It
made a kind of softer daylight, and full in the heart of it
showed Mrs. LeGrand's handsome, not yet elderly countenance,
the ripe fullness of her bust, covered by a figured silk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
dressing-sacque, and her smooth, well-shaped, carefully tended
hands. Hagar conceived that it was her duty to think well
and highly of Mrs. LeGrand, who was such an old friend of
the family, and who, she knew, out of these same friendly
considerations, was keeping her at Eglantine on the easiest
of terms. Yes, it was certainly her duty to love and admire
Mrs. LeGrand. That she did not do so caused her qualms
of conscience. Many of the girls raved about Mrs. LeGrand,
and so did Miss Carlisle and Miss Bedford. Hagar supposed
with a sigh that there was something wrong with her own
heart. To-day, as she sat in the straight chair, her hands
folded in her lap, she experienced a resurgence of an old
childhood dislike. She saw again the Gilead Balm library,
and the pool of sunlight on the floor and the "Descent of
Man," and heard again Mrs. LeGrand telling the Bishop
that she&mdash;Hagar&mdash;was reading an improper book. Time
between then and now simply took itself away like a painted
drop-scene. Six years rolled themselves up as with a spring,
and that hour seamlessly adjoined this hour.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," said Mrs. LeGrand, "that you'll be a little
lonely, dear child, but it won't be for long. Time flies so!"</p>

<p>"I don't exactly get lonely," said Hagar gravely. "You
are going down the river, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for ten days. My dear friends at Idlewood won't
hear of my not coming. They were my dear husband's dearest
cousins. Mrs. Lane and Miss Bedford, together with
Mrs. Brown, will take, I am sure, the best of care of things
here."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. We'll get on beautifully," said Hagar.
"Mr. Laydon is not going away either. His mother is ill and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
he will not leave her. He says that if we like to listen, he will
come over in the evenings and read aloud to us."</p>

<p>Mr. Laydon was teacher of Belles-Lettres at Eglantine, a
well-looking young gentleman, with a good voice, and
apparently a sincere devotion to the best literature. Eglantine
and Mr. Laydon alike believed in the future of Mr.
Laydon. It was understood that his acceptance of a position
here was of the nature of a makeshift, a mere pot-boiler on
his road to high places. He and his mother were domiciled
with a cousin from whose doorstep you might toss a pebble
into the Eglantine grounds. In the past few years the neighbouring
town had begun to grow; it had thrown out a street
which all but touched the osage-orange hedge.</p>

<p>Mrs. LeGrand made a slight motion with her hand on which
was her wedding-ring, with an old pearl ring for guard. "I
shall tell Mrs. Lane not to let him do that too often. I have
a great esteem for Mr. Laydon, but Eglantine cannot be too
careful. No one with girls in their charge can be too careful!&mdash;What
is the Gilead Balm news?"</p>

<p>"The letter was from grandmother. She is well, and so is
grandfather. They have had a great deal of company. Uncle
Bob has had rheumatism, but he goes hunting just the same.
The Hawk Nest Coltsworths are coming for Christmas&mdash;all
except Ralph. He is going home with a classmate. Grandmother
says he is the handsomest man at the University, and
that if I hear tales of his wildness I am not to believe them.
She says all men are a little wild at first. Aunt Serena is
learning how to illuminate texts. Mrs. Green has gone to see
her daughter, who has something the matter with her spine.
Thomasine's uncle in New York is going to have her visit him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and grandmother thinks he means to get Thomasine a place
in a store. Grandmother says no girl ought to work in a store,
but Thomasine's people are very poor, and I don't see what
she can do. She's got to live. Corker has a place, but he
isn't doing very well. Car'line and Isham have put a porch
to their cabin, and Mary Magazine has gotten religion."</p>

<p>"Girls of Thomasine's station," said Mrs. LeGrand, "are
beginning more and more, I'm sorry to see, to leave home
to work for pay. It's spreading, too; it's not confined to girls
of her class. Only yesterday I heard that a bright, pretty
girl that I used to know at the White had gone to Philadelphia
to study to be a nurse, and there's Nellie Wynne trying to be
a journalist! A journalist! There isn't the least excuse for
either of those cases. One of those girls has a brother and
the other a father quite able to support them."</p>

<p>"But if there really isn't any one?" said Hagar wistfully.
"And if you feel that you are costing a lot&mdash;" Her dreams
at night were beginning to be shot with a vague but insistent
"If I could write&mdash;if I could paint or teach&mdash;if I could
earn money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is almost always some one," answered Mrs.
LeGrand. "And if a girl knows how to make the best of
herself, there inevitably arrives her own establishment and
the right man to take care of her. If"&mdash;she shrugged&mdash;"if
she doesn't know how to make the best of herself, she
might as well go work in a store. No one would especially
object. That is, they would not object except that when that
kind of thing creeps up higher in the scale of society, and
girls who can perfectly well be supported at home go out
and work for pay, it makes an unfortunate kind of precedent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and reacts and reflects upon those who do know how to make
the best of themselves."</p>

<p>Hagar spoke diffidently. "But a lot of women had to work
after the war. Mrs. Lane and General &mdash;&mdash;'s daughters, and
you yourself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is quite different," said Mrs. LeGrand. "Gentlewomen
in reduced circumstances may have to battle alone
with the world, but they do not like it, and it is only hard
fate that has put them in that position. It's an unnatural
one, and they feel it as such. What I am talking of is that
nowadays you see women&mdash;young women&mdash;actually choosing
to stand alone, actually declining support, and&mdash;er&mdash;refusing
generally to make the best of themselves. It's part of
the degeneracy of the times that you begin to see women&mdash;women
of breeding&mdash;in all kinds of public places, working
for their living. It's positively shocking! It opens the gate
to all kinds of things."</p>

<p>"Wrong things?"</p>

<p>"Ideas, notions. Roger Michael's ideas, for instance,&mdash;which
I must say are extremely wrong-headed. I regretted
that I had asked her here. She was hardly feminine." Mrs.
LeGrand stretched herself, rubbed her plump, firm arms,
from which the figured silk had fallen back, and rose from
the couch. "I hope that Eglantine girls will always think
of these things as ladies should. And now, my dear, will you
tell Mrs. Lane that I want to see her?"</p>

<p>Mrs. LeGrand went away from Eglantine for ten days.
Of the women teachers living in the house, all went but Mrs.
Lane and Miss Bedford. All the girls went but three, and
they were, first, Hagar Ashendyne; second, a pale thin girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
from the Far South, a martyr to sick headaches; and third,
Francie Smythe, a girl apparently without many home
people. Francie was sweetly dull, with small eyes and a
perpetual smile.</p>

<p>How quiet seemed the great house with its many rooms!
They closed the large dining-room and used the small room
where Roger Michael had supped. They shut the classrooms
and the study-hall and the book-room, and sat in the evenings
in the bowery, flowery parlour. Here, the very first
evening, and the second, came Mr. Laydon with Browning
in one pocket and Tennyson in the other.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane was knitting an afghan of a complicated pattern.
Her lips moved softly, continuously, counting. Mr. Laydon,
making an eloquent pause midway of "Tithonous" caught
this <i>One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four</i>&mdash;and had a fleeting expression
of pain. Mrs. Lane saw the depth to which she had
sunk in his esteem and flushed over her delicate, pensive
face. For the remainder of the hour she sat with her knitting
in her lap. But really the afghan must be finished, and
so, the second evening, she placed her chair so as to face not
the reader but a shadowy corner, and so knit and counted in
peace. Miss Bedford neither knit nor counted; she said that
she adored poetry and sighed rapturously where something
seemed to be indicated. She also adored conversation and
argumentation as to this or that nice point. What did Mr.
Laydon think Browning really meant in "Childe Roland,"
and was Porphyria's lover really mad? Was Amy really to
blame in "Locksley Hall"? Miss Bedford made play with
her rather fine eyes and teased the fringe of the table-cover.
The pale girl from the Far South&mdash;Lily was her name&mdash;sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
by the fire and now rubbed her forehead with a menthol
pencil and now stroked Tipsy Parson, Mrs. LeGrand's big
black cat. Francie Smythe had a muslin apron full of coloured
silks and was embroidering a centre-piece&mdash;yellow
roses with leaves and thorns. Francie was a great embroiderer.
Hagar sat upon a low stool by the hearth, over against
Lily, close to the slowly burning logs. She was a Fire-Worshipper.
The flames were better to her than jewels, and
the glowing alleys and caverns below were treasure caves
and temples. She sat listening in the rosy light, her chin
in her hands. She thought that Mr. Laydon read very well&mdash;very
well, indeed.</p>

<div class="poem">
"'Where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiles,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Miles and miles,</span><br />
On the solitary pastures&mdash;'"<br />
</div>

<p>Midway of the poem she turned a little so that she could
see the reader.</p>

<p>He sat in the circle of lamplight, a presentable man, well-formed,
dark-eyed, and enthusiastic; fairly presentable
within, too, very fairly clean, a good son, filled with not
unhonourable ambitions; good, average, human stuff with
an individual touch of impressionability and a strong desire
to be liked, as he expressed it, "for himself"; young still,
with the momentum and emanation of youth. The lamp had
a rose and amber shade. It threw a softened, coloured,
dreamy light. Everything within its range was subtly
altered and enriched.</p>

<div class="poem">
"'And I knew&mdash;while thus the quiet-coloured eve<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 6em;">Smiles to leave</span><br />
To their folding, all our many tinkling fleece<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">In such peace,</span><br />
And the slopes and rills in undistinguished grey<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Melt away&mdash;'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Hagar sat in her corner, upon the low stool, in the firelight,
as motionless as though she were in a trance. Her eyes,
large, of a marvellous hazel, beneath straight, well-pencilled
brows of deepest brown, were fixed steadily upon the man
reading. Slowly, tentatively, something rich and delicate
seemed to rise within her, something that clung to soul and
body, something strange, sweet and painful, something that,
spreading and deepening with great swiftness, suffused her
being and made her heart at once ecstatic and sorrowful. She
blushed deeply, felt the crimsoning, and wished to drop her
head upon her arms and be alone in a balmy darkness. It
was as though she were in a strange dream, or in one of her
long romances come real.</p>

<div class="poem">
"'In one year they sent a million fighters forth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">South and North,&mdash;</span><br />
And they built their gods a brazen pillar high<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">As the sky&mdash; ...</span><br />
... Love is best.'"<br />
</div>

<p>Laydon put the book down upon the table. While he read,
one of the maids, Zinia, had brought a note to Miss Bedford,
and that lady had gone away to answer it. Mrs. Lane knitted
on, her lips moving, her back to the table and the hearth.
Francie Smythe was sorting silks. "That was a lovely piece,"
she said unemotionally, and went on dividing orange from
lemon. The girl with the menthol pencil was more appreciative.
"Once, when I was a little girl I went with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
father and mother to Rome. We went out on the Campagna.
I remember now how it was all green and flat and wide as
the sea and still, and there were great arches running away&mdash;away&mdash;and
a mist that they said was fever." Her voice
sank. She sighed and rubbed her forehead with the menthol.
Her eyes closed.</p>

<p>Edgar Laydon rose and came into the circle of firelight.
He was moved by his own reading, shaken with the impulse
and rhythm of the poem. He stood by the mantel and faced
Hagar. She was one of his pupils, she recited well; of the
essays, the "compositions," which were produced under his
direction, hers were the best; he had told her more than once
that her work was good; in short, he was kindly disposed toward
her. To this instant that was all; he was scrupulously
correct in his attitude toward the young ladies whom he
taught. He had for his work a kind of unnecessary scorn; he
felt that he ought to be teaching men, or at the very least
should hold a chair in some actual college for women. Eglantine
was nothing but a Young Ladies' Seminary. He felt
quite an enormous gulf between himself and those around
him, and, as a weakness will sometimes quaintly do, this
feeling kept him steady. Until this moment he was as indifferent
to Hagar Ashendyne, as to any one of the fifty
whom he taught, and he was indifferent to them all. He had
a picture in his mind of the woman whom some day he meant
to find and woo, but she wasn't in the least like any one at
Eglantine.</p>

<p>Now, in an instant, came a change. Hagar's eyes, very
quiet and limpid, were upon him. Perhaps, deep down, far
distant from her conscious self, she willed and exercised an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
ancient power of her sex and charmed him to her; perhaps&mdash;in
his lifted mood, the great, sensuous swing of the verse
still with him, the written cry of passion faintly drumming
within his veins&mdash;he would have suddenly linked that diffused
emotion to whatever presence, young and far from unpleasing,
might have risen at this moment to confront him.
However that may be, Laydon's eyes and those of Hagar
met. Each gaze held the other for a breathless moment,
then the lids fell, the heart beat violently, a colour surged
over the face and receded, leaving each face pale. A log,
burned through, parted, striking the hearth with a sound
like the click of a closing trap.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane, having come to an easy part in the pattern,
turned her face to the rest of the room. "Aren't we going to
have some more poetry? Read us some more, Mr. Laydon."</p>

<p>The girl with the menthol pencil spoke dreamily. "Isn't
there another piece about the Campagna? I can see it plain&mdash;green
like the sea and arches and tombs and a mist hanging
over it, and a road going on&mdash;a road going on&mdash;a road
going on."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

HAGAR AND LAYDON</h2>


<p>This is what they did. The next day was soft as balm. To
Hagar, sitting in the sun on the step of the west porch, came
the sound of steps over the fallen leaves of what was called
at Eglantine the Syringa Alley&mdash;sycamore boughs above
and syringa bushes thickly planted and grown tall, making
winding walls for a winding path. The red surged over
Hagar, her eyes, dark-ringed, half-closed. Laydon, emerging
from the alley, came straight toward her, over a space of
gravel and wind-brought leaves. It was mid-morning, the
place open and sunny, to be viewed from more windows than
one, with the servants, moreover, going to and fro on their
morning business, apt to pass this gable end. Aunt Dorinda,
for instance, the old, turbaned cook, passed, but she saw
nothing but one of the teachers stopping to say, "Merry
Christmas!" to Miss Hagar. All the servants liked Miss
Hagar.</p>

<p>What Laydon said was not "Merry Christmas!" but,
"Hagar, Hagar! that was Love came to us last night! I have
not slept. I have been like a madman all night! I did not
know there was such a force in the world."</p>

<p>"I did not sleep either," answered Hagar. "I did not sleep
at all."</p>

<p>"Every one can see us here. Let us walk toward the gate,
through the alley."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>She rose from the step and went with him. Well in the
shelter of the syringa, hidden from the house, he stopped,
and laid his hands lightly upon her shoulders, then, as she
did not resist, drew her to him. They kissed, they clung
together in a long embrace, they uttered love's immemorial
words, smothering each with each, then they fell apart;
and Hagar first buried her face in her hands, then, uncovering
it, broke into tremulous laughter, laughter that had a
sobbing note.</p>

<p>"What will they say at Gilead Balm&mdash;oh, what will they
say at Gilead Balm?"</p>

<p>"Say!" answered Laydon. "They'll say that they wish
your happiness! Hagar, how old are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm nearly eighteen."</p>

<p>"And old for your years. And I&mdash;I am twenty-eight, and
young for my years." Laydon laughed, too. He was giddy
with happiness. "Gilead Balm! What a strange name for a
place&mdash;and you've lived there always&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Always."</p>

<p>They were moving now down the alley toward a gate that
gave upon the highroad. Near by lay an open field seized
upon, at Christmas, by a mob of small boys with squibs and
torpedoes and cannon crackers. They had a bonfire, and the
wood smoke drifted across, together with the odour of burning
powder. The boys were shouting like Liliputian soldiery,
and the squibs and giant crackers shook the air as with a
continuous elfin bombardment. The nearest church was
ringing its bells. Laydon and Hagar came to the gate&mdash;not
the main but a lesser entrance to Eglantine. No one was
in view; hand in hand they leaned against the wooden palings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Before them stretched the road, an old, country pike
going on and on between cedar and locust and thorn until it
dropped into the violet distance.</p>

<p>"I wish we were out upon it," said Hagar; "I wish we
were out upon it, going on and on through the world, travelling
like gipsies!"</p>

<p>"You look like a gipsy," he said. "Have you got gipsy
blood in you?"</p>

<p>"No.... Yes. Just to go on and on. The open road&mdash;and
a clear fire at night&mdash;and to see all things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hagar&mdash;Why did they call you Hagar?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. My mother named me."</p>

<p>"Hagar, we've got to think a little.... It took us so
by surprise.... We had best, I think, just quietly say
nothing to anybody for a while.... Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"I had not thought about it, but I will," said Hagar. She
gazed down the road, her brows knit. The Christmas cannonading
went on, a continuous miniature tearing and shaking
of the air, with a dwarf shouting and laughing, and small
coalescing clouds of powder smoke. The road ran, a quiet,
sunny streak, past this small bedlam, into the still distance.
"I won't tell any one at Eglantine," she said at last, "until
Mrs. LeGrand comes back. She will be back in a week. But
I'll write to grandmother to-night."</p>

<p>Laydon measured the gate with his hand. "I had rather
not tell my mother at once. She is very delicate and nervous,
and perhaps she has grown a little selfish in her love for me.
Besides, she had set her heart on&mdash;" He threw that matter
aside, it being a young and attractive kinswoman with
money. "I had rather not tell her just now. Then, as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Mrs. LeGrand.... Of course, I suppose, as I am a teacher
here, and you are a pupil ... but there, too, had we not
best delay a little? It will make a confusion&mdash;things will
be said&mdash;my position will become an embarrassing one.
And you, too, Hagar,&mdash;it won't be pleasant for you either.
Isn't it better just to keep our own concerns to ourselves for
a while? And your people up the river&mdash;why not <i>not</i> tell
them until summer-time? Then, when you go home,&mdash;and
when I have finished my engagement here, for I don't propose
to come back to Eglantine next year,&mdash;then you can
tell them, and so much better than you could write it! I
could follow you to Gilead Balm&mdash;we could tell them
together. Then we could discuss matters and our future
intelligently&mdash;and that is impossible at the moment. Let
us just quietly keep our happiness to ourselves for a while!
Why should the world pry into it?" He seized her hands
and pressed his face against them. "Let us be happy and
silent."</p>

<p>She looked at him with her candid eyes. "No, we shouldn't
be happy that way. I'll write to grandmother to-night."</p>

<p>They gazed at each other, the gate between them. The
strong enchantment held, but a momentary perplexity
crossed it, and the never long-laid dust of pain was stirred.
"I am not asking anything wrong," said Laydon, a hurt note
in his voice. "I only see certain embarrassments&mdash;difficulties
that may arise. But, darling, darling! it shall be just
as you please! 'I'd crowns resign to call you mine'&mdash;and
so I reckon I can face mother and Mrs. LeGrand and Colonel
Ashendyne!" A flush came into his cheek. "I've been so
foolish, too, as to&mdash;as to pay a little attention to Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Bedford. But she is too sensible a woman to think that I
meant anything seriously&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," said Laydon truthfully. "A man gets
lonely, and he craves affection and understanding, and he's
in a muddle before he knows it. There isn't anything else
there, and I never said a word of <i>love</i> to her. Darling,
darling! I never loved any one until last night by the fire,
and you looked up at me with those wonderful eyes, and I
looked down, and our eyes met and held, and it was like a
fine flame all over&mdash;and now I'm yours till death&mdash;and
I'll run any gauntlet you tell me to run! If you write to your
people to-night, so will I. I'll write to Colonel Ashendyne."</p>

<p>They left the gate and again pursued the syringa alley.
The sound of the Christmas bombardment drifted away.
When they reached the shadow of the great bushes, he kissed
her again. All the air was blue and hazy and the church
bells were ringing, ringing. "I haven't any money," said
Laydon. "Mother has a very little, but I've never been able,
somehow, to lay by. I'll begin now, though, and then, as I
told you, I expect next year to have a much better situation.
Dr. &mdash;&mdash; at &mdash;&mdash; thinks he may get me in there. It would
be delightful&mdash;a real field at last, the best of surroundings
and a tolerable salary. If I were fortunate there, we could
marry very soon, darling, darling! But as it is&mdash;It is
wretched that Eglantine pays so little, and that there is so
little recognition here of ability&mdash;no career&mdash;no opportunity!
But just you wait and see&mdash;you one bright spot
here!"</p>

<p>Hagar gazed at the winding path, strewn with bronze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
leaves, and at the syringa bushes, later to be laden with
fragrant bloom, and at the great white sycamore boughs
against the pallid blue, and at the roof and chimneys of
Eglantine, now apparent behind the fretwork of trees. The
inner eye saw the house within, the three-years-familiar
rooms, her "tower room"&mdash;and all the human life, the girls,
the teachers, the servants. Bright drops came to her eyes.
"I've been unhappy here, too, sometimes. But I couldn't
stay three years in a place and not love something about it."</p>

<p>"That is because you are a woman," said the lover. "With
a man it is different. If a place isn't right, it isn't right.&mdash;If
I had but five thousand dollars! Then we might marry
in a month's time. As it is, we'll have to wait and wait
and wait&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am going to work, too," said Hagar. "I am going to
try somehow to make money."</p>

<p>He laughed. "You dear gipsy! You just keep your beautiful,
large eyes, and those dusky warm waves of hair, and
your long slim fingers, and the way you hold yourself, and
let 'trying to earn money' go hang! That's my part. Too
many women are trying to earn money, anyhow&mdash;competing
with us.&mdash;You've got just to be your beautiful self, and keep
on loving me." He drew a long breath. "Jove! I can see you
now, in a parlour that's our own at &mdash;&mdash;, receiving guests&mdash;famous
guests, maybe, after a while; people who will come
distances to see me! For I don't mean to remain unknown.
I know I've got ability."</p>

<p>Before they left the alley they settled that both should
write that night to Gilead Balm. Laydon found the idea
distasteful enough; older and more worldly-wise than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
other, he knew that there would probably ensue a tempest,
and he was constitutionally averse to tempests. He was well
enough in family, but no great things; he had a good education,
but so had others; he could give a good character&mdash;already
he was running over in mind a list of clergymen,
educators, prominent citizens, and Confederate veterans to
whom he could refer Colonel Ashendyne. He had some doubt,
however, as to whether comparative spotlessness of character
would have with Colonel Ashendyne the predominant and
overweening value that it should have. Money&mdash;he had no
means; position&mdash;he had as yet an uncertain foothold in the
world, and no powerful relatives to push him. Unbounded
confidence he had in himself, but the point was to create that
confidence in Hagar's people. Of course, they would say that
she was too young, and that he had taken advantage. His
skirts were clear there; both had truthfully been taken prisoners,
fallen into an ambuscade of ancient instinct; there
hadn't been the slightest premeditation. But how to convey
that fact to the old Bourbon up the river? Laydon had once
been introduced to Colonel Ashendyne upon one of the
latter's rare visits to the neighbouring city and to Eglantine.
He remembered stingingly the Colonel's calm and gentlemanly
willingness immediately to forget the existence of a
teacher of Belles-Lettres in a Young Ladies' School. The
letter to Gilead Balm. He didn't want to write it, but he was
going to&mdash;oh! he was going to.... Women were curiously
selfish about some things.... Mrs. LeGrand, too; he
thought that he would write about it to Mrs. LeGrand. He
could imagine what she would say, and he didn't want to
hear it. He was in love, and he was going to do the honourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
thing, of course; he had no idea otherwise. But he certainly
entertained the wish that Hagar could see how entirely
honourable, as well as discreet, would be silence for a while.</p>

<p>Hagar never thought of it in terms of "honour." She had
no adequate idea of his reluctance. It might be said that she
knew already the arching of Mrs. LeGrand's brows and the
lightning and thunder that might issue from Gilead Balm.
Grandfather and grandmother, Aunt Serena and Uncle Bob
looked upon her as nothing but a child. She wasn't a child;
she was eighteen. She felt no need to vindicate herself, nor
to apologize. She was moving through what was still almost
pure bliss, moving with a dreamlike tolerance of difficulties.
What did it matter, all those things? They were so
little. The air was wine and velvet, colours were at once soft
and clear, sound was golden. In the general transfiguration
the man by her side appeared much like a demigod. Her
wings were fairly caught and held by the honey. It was natural
for her to act straightforwardly, and when she must propose
that she act so still, it was simply a putting forward,
an unveiling of the mass of her nature. She showed herself
thus and so, and then went on in her happy dream. Had he
been able to make her realize his great magnanimity in giving
up his point of view to hers, perhaps she might have
striven for magnanimity, too, and acquiesced in a temporary
secrecy, perhaps not&mdash;on the whole, perhaps not. Had she
deeply felt the secrecy to be necessary, had they paced the
earth in another time and amid actual dangers, wild beasts
could not have torn from her a relation of their case.</p>

<p>But Laydon thought that she was thinking in terms of
"honour." Pure women were naturally up in arms at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
suggestion of secrecy. Their delicate minds had at once a
vision of deception, desertion, all kinds of horrors. He
acknowledged that men had given them reason for the
vision; they could not be blamed if they saw it even when
an entirely honourable and devoted man was at their feet.
He smiled at what he supposed Hagar thought; his warm
sense of natural supremacy became rich and deep; he felt
like an Eastern king unfolding a generous and noble nature
to some suppliant who had reason to doubt those qualities
in Eastern kings at large&mdash;he experienced a sumptuous,
Oriental, Ahasuerus-and-Esther feeling. Poor little girl! If
she had any absurd fear like that&mdash;He began to be eager
to get to the letter to Colonel Ashendyne. He could see
his own strong black handwriting on a large sheet of bond
paper. <i>My dear Colonel Ashendyne:&mdash;You will doubtless
be surprised at the nature and contents of this letter, but I beg
of you to</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>The syringa alley ended, and the west wing of the house,
beyond which stretched the offices, opened upon them.
Zinia, the mulatto maid, and old Daniel, the gardener,
watched them from a doorway. "My Lord!" said Zinia.
"Dey's walkin' right far apart, but I knows a co'tin' air when
I sees it! Miss Sarah better come back here!"</p>

<p>Daniel frowned. He had been born on the Eglantine place
and the majesty and honour and glory of Eglantine were his.
"Shet yo' mouf, gal! Don't no co'tin' occur at Eglantine.
Hit's Christmas an' everybody looks good an' shinin' lak de
angels. Dey two jes' been listenin' to de 'lumination an'
talkin' jography an' Greek!"</p>

<p>As the two stepped upon the west porch, the door opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and Miss Bedford came out&mdash;Miss Bedford in a very pretty
red hood and a Connemara cloak. Miss Bedford had a sharp
look. "Where did you two find each other?" she asked; then,
without waiting for an answer, "Hagar! Mrs. Lane has been
looking for you. She wants you to help her do up parcels for
her mission children. I've been tying up things until I am
tired, and now I am going to walk down the avenue for a
breath of air. Hurry in, dear; she needs you.&mdash;Oh, Mr.
Laydon! there's a passage in 'The Ring and the Book' that
I've been wanting to ask you to explain&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hagar went in and tied up parcels in coloured tissue paper.
The day went by as in a dream. There was a Christmas
dinner, with holly on the table, and little red candles, and in
the afternoon she went with Mrs. Lane to a Christmas tree
for poor children in the Sunday-School room of a neighbouring
church. The tree blazed with an unearthly splendour, the
star in the top seemed effulgent, the "Ohs!" and "Ahs!"
and laughter of the circling children, fell into a rhythm like
sweet, low, distant thunder.</p>

<p>That night she wrote both to her grandmother and her
grandfather. When she had made an end of doing so, she
kneeled upon the braided rug before the fire in her tower room,
loosed her dark hair, shook it around her, and sat as in a tent,
her arms clasping her knees, her head bowed upon them.
"<i>Carcassonne&mdash;Aigues-Mortes. Carcassonne&mdash;Aigues-Mortes.</i>
I can't send a letter to father, for I don't know where to
address it. Mother&mdash;mother&mdash;mother! I can't send a
letter to you either...."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

ROMEO AND JULIET</h2>


<p>That week a noted actress played Juliet several evenings in
succession at the theatre in the neighbouring town. The
ladies left adrift at Eglantine read in the morning paper a
glowing report of the performance. Miss Bedford said she
was going; she never missed an opportunity to see "Romeo
and Juliet."</p>

<p>Mr. Laydon, walking in at that moment&mdash;they were all
in the small book-room&mdash;caught the statement. "Why
shouldn't you all go? I have seen her play it once, but I'd
like to see it again." He laughed. "I feel reckless and I'm
going to get up a theatre-party! Mrs. Lane, won't you go?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane shook her head. "My theatre days are over,"
she said in her gentle, plaintive voice. "Thank you just the
same, Mr. Laydon. But the others might like to go."</p>

<p>"Miss Bedford&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We ought," said Miss Bedford, "by rights to have Mrs.
Lane to chaperon us, but it's Christmas, isn't it?&mdash;and
everybody's a little mad! Thank you, Mr. Laydon."</p>

<p>Laydon looked at Francie. "Miss Smythe, won't you
come, too?" He had made a rapid calculation. Yes, it
would cost only so much,&mdash;they would go in of course on
the street car,&mdash;and in order to ask one he would have to
ask all.</p>

<p>Yes, Francie would go, though she was sorry that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Shakespeare, and just caught herself in time from saying so.
"It will be lovely," she said, instead, unemotionally.</p>

<p>Miss Bedford supplied the lacking enthusiasm. "It will
be the treat of the winter! Oh, the Balcony Scene, and where
she drinks the sleeping-draught, and the tomb&mdash;" She
moved nearer Laydon as she spoke and managed to convey
to him, <i>sotto voce</i>, "You mustn't be extravagant, you generous
man! Don't think that you have to ask these girls just
because they are in the room." But she was too late; Laydon
was already asking.</p>

<p>"Miss Goldwell, won't you come, too, to see 'Romeo and
Juliet'?"</p>

<p>If she didn't have a headache, Miss Goldwell would be
glad to,&mdash;"Thank you, Mr. Laydon."</p>

<p>"Miss Ashendyne, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you."</p>

<p>"I will go at once," said Laydon, "and get the tickets."</p>

<p>In the end, Lily Goldwell went, and Francie Smythe did
not. Francie developed a sore throat that put Mrs. Lane in
terror of tonsillitis. Nothing must go wrong&mdash;nobody must
get ill while dear Mrs. LeGrand was away!&mdash;it would be
madness for Francie to go out. Where "what Mrs. LeGrand
might think" came into it, Mrs. Lane was adamant.
Francie sullenly stayed at home. Lily, for a marvel, didn't
have a headache, and she said she would take her menthol
pencil, in case the music should bring on one.</p>

<p>The four walked down the avenue, beneath the whispering
trees. There was no moon, but the stars shone bright,
and it was not cold. Mr. Laydon and Miss Bedford went a
little in front, and Lily and Hagar followed. They passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
through the big gate and, walking down the road a little way,
came to where the road became a street, and, at ten minutes'
interval, a street-car jingled up, reversed, and jingled back
to town again.</p>

<p>On the street-car Miss Bedford and Mr. Laydon were
again together, and Lily and Hagar. Between the two pairs
stretched a row of men, several with the evening newspaper.
It was too warm in the car, and Lily, murmuring something,
took out her menthol pencil. Hagar studied the score of
occupants, and the row of advertisements, and the dark
night without the windows. The man next her had a newspaper,
and now he began to talk to an older man beside
him.</p>

<p>"The country's doing pretty well, seems to me."</p>

<p>The other grunted. "Isn't anything doing pretty well.
I'm getting to be a Populist."</p>

<p>"Oh, go away! Are you going to the World's Fair?"</p>

<p>"No. There's going to be the biggest panic yet in this
country about one year from now."</p>

<p>"Oh, cheer up! You've been living on Homestead."</p>

<p>"If I have, it's poor living."</p>

<p>Across the aisle a woman was talking about the famine in
Russia. "We are going to try to get up a bazaar and make a
little money to send to get food with. Tolstoy&mdash;"</p>

<p>The horse-car jingled, jingled through the night. All the
windows were down; it grew hot and close and crowded.
The black night without pressed alongside, peered through
the clouded glass. Within were a muddy glare and swaying
and the mingled breath of people.</p>

<p>Lily sighed. "Don't you ever wish for just a clear Nothing?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
No pain, no feeling, no people, no light, no sound,
no anything?"</p>

<p>The street-car turned a corner and swayed and jingled
into a lighted, business street, where were Christmas windows
and upon the pavement a Christmas throng. A drug
store&mdash;a wine and liquor store&mdash;a grocery&mdash;a clothing
store&mdash;a wine and liquor store&mdash;a drug store; amber and
crimson, green and blue, broken and restless arrived the
lights through the filmy glass. Laughter and voices of the
crowd came with a distant humming, through which clanged
the street-car bell. The car stopped for passengers, then
creaked on again. A workman entered, stood for a couple of
minutes, touching Hagar's skirt, then, a man opposite rising
and leaving the car, sank into the vacant place. Hagar's eyes
swept him dreamily; then, she knew not why, she fell to observing
him with a puzzled, stealthy gaze. He was certainly
young, and yet he did not look so. The lower part of his face
was covered by a short soft, dark beard; he had a battered
slouch hat pulled down low; the eyes beneath were sombre
and the face lined. There was a dinner pail at his feet. He,
too, had an evening paper; Hagar saw the headlines of the
piece he was reading: "HOMESTEAD"; and underneath,
"STRONG HAND OF THE LAW." Outside, topaz and
ruby and emerald drifted by the windows of a wine and
liquor store.</p>

<p>She knit her brows. Some current in the shoreless sea of
mind had been started, but she could not trace its beginning
nor where it led. Another minute and the car stopped
before the theatre.</p>

<p>Within, Laydon man&oelig;uvred, and the end was that if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
had Miss Bedford upon his right, yet he had Hagar upon his
left. The orchestra had not yet begun; the house was dim,
people entering, those seated having to stand up to let the
others pass. Once, when this happened, he leaned toward
her until their shoulders touched, until his breath was upon
her cheek. He dared so much as to whisper, "If only we
were here, just you and I, together!"</p>

<p>Every one was seated now, and she looked at the people
with their festal, Christmas air. There was a girl in a box
who was like Sylvie, and nearer yet a grey-haired gentleman
with a certain vague resemblance to her grandfather. Her
thought flashed across the dark country, up the winding,
amber-hued river to Gilead Balm. They would have had her
letter yesterday. The shimmer and murmur of the filled
theatre were all about her, but so was Gilead Balm&mdash;she
tried to hear what they would be saying there to-night. The
music began, and in a moment she was in a colourful dream.
The curtain went up, and here was the hot, sunshiny street
of Verona and all the heady wine of youth and love.</p>

<p>When the curtain fell and the lights brightened, Miss Bedford,
after frantically applauding, claimed Laydon for her
own. She had raptures to impart, criticisms to exchange,
knowledge to imbibe. Minutes passed ere, during a momentary
lapse into her programme, Laydon could bend toward
the lady on his left. Did she like it? What did she think of
Juliet?&mdash;What did she think of Romeo?&mdash;Was it not well-staged?</p>

<p>Hagar did not know whether it were well staged or not.
She was eighteen years old; she had been very seldom to the
theatre; she was moving through a dreamy paradise. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
wanted just to sit still and bring it all back before the inner
eye. Despite the fact that he was her lover, she was not sorry
when Laydon must turn to the lady on his right. When Lily
spoke to her, she said, "Don't let's talk. Let's sit still and
see it all again." Lily agreed. She was no chatterbox herself.
The music played; the lights in the house were lowered; up,
slowly, gently, went the curtain; here was the orchard of the
Capulets.</p>

<p>The great concave of the theatre was dim. Laydon's
hand sought Hagar's, found it in the semi-darkness, held it
throughout the act. She acquiesced; and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;She
did not wish him to fondle her hand, nor yet, as once or
twice he did, to whisper to her. She wished to listen, listen.
She was in Verona, not here.</p>

<p>The act closed. The lights went up, Laydon softly withdrew
his hand. He applauded loudly, all the house applauded.
Hagar hated the clapping, not experienced enough to know
how breath-of-life it was to the people behind the curtain.
Already the curtain was rising for Juliet to come forth and
bow, and then for Juliet to bring forth Romeo, and both to
bow. Had she known, she would have applauded, too; she
was a kindly child. The curtain was down now, the house
rustling. All around was talking; people seemed never to
wish to be quiet. Laydon was talking, too, answering Miss
Bedford's artful-artless queries, embarking on a commentary
upon act and actors. He talked with a conscious brilliance
as became a professor of Belles-Lettres, more especially for
Hagar's delight, but aware also that the people directly in
front and behind were listening. Was Hagar delighted?
Very slowly and insidiously, like a slender serpent stealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
into some Happy Valley, there came into her heart a distaste
for commentaries. As the valley might be ignorant of
the serpent, so neither did she know what was the matter;
she was only not so mystically happy as she had been before.</p>

<p>The orchestra came back, there was a murmur of expectation,
Laydon ceased to discourse of Bandello, and of Dante's
reference to Montague and Capulet. Lily, on the other side
of Hagar, complained of the heat and the music. "I like
stringed instruments, but those great brass horns make the
back of my head hurt so."</p>

<p>Hagar touched her cold, little hand. "Poor Lily! I wish
you didn't feel badly all the time! I wish you liked the
horns."</p>

<p>The curtain rose, the play rolled on. Mercutio was slain,&mdash;Mercutio
and Tybalt,&mdash;Romeo was banished. The scene
changed, and here was the great window of Juliet's room&mdash;the
rope ladder&mdash;the envious East.</p>

<div class="poem">
"<i>Night's candles are burned out and jocund day<br />
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain-tops;<br />
I must be gone and live, or stay and die</i>&mdash;"<br />
</div>

<p>Hagar sat, bent forward, her eyes dark and wide, the wine-red
in her cheeks. When the curtain went down she did not
move; Laydon, under cover of the loud applause, spoke to
her twice before she attended. Her eyes came back from a
long way off, her mind turned with difficulty. "Yes? What
is it?" Laydon was easily aggrieved. "You are thinking
more of this wretched play," he whispered, "than you are
of me!"</p>

<p>On rolled the swift events, gorgeous and swift as shadows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
The curtain fell, the curtain rose. The potion was drunk&mdash;the
wailing was made&mdash;Balthasar rode to warn Romeo.
There came the last act: the poison&mdash;County Paris&mdash;the
Tomb&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"<i>Here will I set up my everlasting rest</i>&mdash;"<br />
</div>

<p>It was over.... She helped Lily with her red evening cloak,
she found Miss Bedford's striped silk bag that Laydon could
not find; they all passed out of the house of enchantments.
Here was the night, and the night wind, and broken lights and
carriages, and a clamour of voices, and at last the clanging
street-car with a great freight of talking people. She wanted
to sit still and dream it over&mdash;and fortunately Laydon was
again occupied with Miss Bedford.</p>

<p>"You liked it, didn't you?" asked Lily. "I think that
you like things that you imagine better than you like things
that you do."</p>

<p>Hagar looked at her with eyes that were yet wide and
fixed. "I don't know. If you could be and do all that you
can imagine&mdash;but you can't&mdash;you can't&mdash;" she smiled
and rubbed her hand across her eyes&mdash; "and it's a tragedy."</p>

<p>When they left the street-car and walked toward the Eglantine
gates, it was drawing toward midnight. Laydon and
Hagar now moved side by side through the darkness. Lily&mdash;who
said that her head had ached very little, thank you!&mdash;exchanged
comments on the play with Miss Bedford.</p>

<p>Laydon held the gate open; then, closing it, fell a few feet
behind with Hagar. "You enjoyed it?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was again in love. "The plays we'll see together, darling,
darling! 'Two souls with but a single thought&mdash;'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is no need to walk so fast," said Miss Bedford.
"Oh, Mr. Laydon, a briar has caught my skirt&mdash;Will you&mdash;? Oh,
thank you!"</p>

<p>The house showed before them. "The parlour windows
are lighted," said Lily. "Mrs. Lane must have company."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane did have company. She herself opened the front
door to them. Mrs. Lane's eyes were red, and she looked
frightened. "Wait," she said, and got between the little
group and the parlour door. "Lily, you had best go straight
upstairs, my dear! Miss Bedford, will you please wait here
with me just a minute? Mr. Laydon, Mrs. LeGrand says
will you come into the parlour? Hagar, you are to go, too.
Your grandfather is here."</p>

<p>Colonel Ashendyne stood between the table and the fire.
Mrs. LeGrand was seated upon the sofa, which meant that
she sat in state. Mrs. Lane, who came presently stealing in
again, sat back from the centre in a meek, small chair, and at
intervals wiped her eyes. The culprits stood.</p>

<p>Colonel Argall Ashendyne never lacked words with which
to express his meaning&mdash;words that bit. Now his well-cut
lips opened, and out there came like a scimitar his part of
the ensuing conversation.</p>

<p>"Hagar, your letter was read yesterday evening. I immediately
telegraphed to Mrs. LeGrand at Idlewood, and she
obligingly took this morning's boat. I myself came down on
the afternoon train, and got here two hours ago. Now, sir&mdash;" he
turned on Laydon&mdash;"what have you got to say for yourself?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;"began Laydon. He drew a breath and his spine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
stiffened. "I have to say, sir, that I love your granddaughter,
and that I have asked her to marry me."</p>

<p>Mrs. LeGrand, while the colonel's hawk eye dwelt witheringly,
spoke from the sofa. "I have no words, Mr. Laydon,
in which to express my disapproval of your action, or my
disappointment in one whom I had supposed a gentleman.
In my absence you have chosen to abuse my confidence and
to do a most dishonourable and ungentlemanly thing&mdash;a
thing which, were it known, might easily bring disrepute
upon Eglantine. You will understand, of course, that it terminates
your connection with this school&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. LeGrand," said Laydon, "I have done nothing dishonourable."</p>

<p>"You have taken advantage of my absence, sir, to make
love to one of my pupils&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To an inexperienced child, sir," said the Colonel;&mdash;"too
young to know better or to tell pinchbeck when she sees it!
You should be caned."</p>

<p>"Colonel Ashendyne, if you were a younger man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bah!" said the Colonel. "I am younger now and more
real than you!&mdash;Hagar!"</p>

<p>"Yes, grandfather."</p>

<p>"Come here!"</p>

<p>Hagar came. The Colonel laid his hands upon her shoulders,
a little roughly, but not too roughly. The two looked
each other in the eyes. He was tall and she but of medium
height, she was young and he was her elder, he was ancestor
and she descendant, he was her supporter and she his dependant,
he was grandfather and she was grandchild. Gilead
Balm had always inculcated reverence for dominant kin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
family authority. It had been Gilead Balm's grievance, long
ago, against her mother that she recognized that so poorly....
But Hagar had always seemed to recognize it. "Gipsy,"
said the Colonel now, "I am not going to be hard upon you.
It's the nature of the young to be foolish, and a young girl
may be pardoned anything short of the irrecoverable. All
that I want you to do is to see that you have been very foolish
and to say as much to this&mdash;this gentleman. Simply turn
round and say to him 'Mr.&mdash;' What's his name?&mdash;Layton?"</p>

<p>"I wrote to you day before yesterday, Colonel Ashendyne,"
said Laydon. "You saw my name there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never got your letter, sir! I got hers.&mdash;Hagar! say
after me to this gentleman, 'Sir, I was mistaken in my sentiment
toward you, and I here and now release you from any
fancied engagement between us.'&mdash;Say it!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he wheeled her so that she faced Laydon. She
stood, a scarlet in her cheeks, her eyes dark, deep, and angry.
"Hagar!" cried Laydon, maddened, too, "are you going to
say that?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Hagar. "No, I am not going to say it! I
have done nothing wrong nor underhand, and neither have
you! Mrs. LeGrand knew that you were coming here, in the
evening, to read to us. Why shouldn't you come? Well, one
evening you were reading and I was listening, and I was not
thinking of you and you were not thinking of me. And then,
suddenly, something&mdash;Love&mdash;came into this room and
took us prisoner. We did not ask him here, we did not know
anything.... But when it happened we knew it, and next
morning, out in the open air, we told each other about it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Nothing could have kept us from doing that, and nothing
had a right to keep us from it! Nothing!&mdash;And that very
night I wrote to you, grandfather&mdash;and he wrote.... If I
am mistaken I am mistaken, but I will find it out for myself!"
She twisted herself in the Colonel's grasp until she faced him.
"You say that you are real&mdash;Well, I am real too! I am as
real as you are!"</p>

<p>The Colonel's fine, bony hands closed upon her shoulders
until she caught her breath with the pain. The water rushed
to her eyes, but she kept it from over-brimming. "Don't
cry!" said a voice within her. "Whatever you do, don't
cry!" It was like her mother's voice, and she answered instantly.
Colonel Ashendyne, his lips white beneath his grey
mustache, shook her violently, so violently that, pushed
from her footing, she stumbled and sank to her knee.</p>

<p>Laydon came up with clenched fists and the colour gone
from his face. "Let her go, damn you!&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane uttered a faint cry and Mrs. LeGrand rose from
the sofa.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

GILEAD BALM</h2>


<p>The March winds shook the rusty cedars and tossed the pink
peach branches, and carried a fleet of clouds swiftly overhead
through the blue aërial sea. They rattled the windows of
Gilead Balm and bent the chimney smoke aslant like streamers.
The winds were rough but not cold. Now and again they
sank into the sunniest of calms, little periods of stillness,
small doldrums punctuating the stormiest sentences. Then
with a whistle, shriller and shriller, they mounted again, tremendously
exhilarated, sweeping earth and sky.</p>

<p>On the ridge back of Gilead Balm the buds of the cucumber
tree were swelling, the grass beneath was growing green,
the ants were out in the sunshine. Up in the branches a bluebird
was exploring building-sites.</p>

<p>Hagar came wandering over the ridge. The wind wrapped
her old brown dress about her limbs and blew her dark hair
into locks and tendrils. Luna followed her, but Luna in no
frolicsome mood. Luna was old, old, and to-day dispirited
because Captain Bob had gone to a meeting of Democrats
in the neighbouring town and had left her behind. Depression
was writ in every line of Luna's body, and an old, experienced
weariness and disillusionment in the eye with which
she looked askance at a brand-new white butterfly on a
brand-new dandelion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Hagar stood with her back to the cucumber tree and surveyed
the scene. The hills, scurried over by the shadows of
the driven clouds, the river&mdash;the river winding down to the
sea, and the ditch where used to be the canal; and away,
away, the white plume of a passenger train. She was mad for
travel, for wandering, for the open road; all the world sung
to her as with a thousand tongues in the books she read.
Pictures, cathedrals, statues, cities, snow on mountains, the
ocean, deserts, torrid lands, France, Spain, Italy, England&mdash;oh,
to go, to go! She would have liked to fling herself on the
blowing wind and go with it over land and sea.</p>

<p>She looked with hot, sombre eyes at Gilead Balm. It was
the home she had always known and she loved it; it was
home,&mdash;yes, it was home; but it was not so pleasant at
home just now. March&mdash;and the Colonel had withdrawn
her from Eglantine, ordered her home, the first of January!
January, February, a part of March&mdash;and her grandfather
still eaten with a cold anger every time he looked at her,
and her grandmother, outraged at her suddenly manifested
likeness to Maria and Maria's "ways," almost as bad! Aunt
Serena gave her no sympathy; Aunt Serena had become
almost violent on the subject. If you were going to rebel and
disobey, Aunt Serena told her, if you were going to be forward
and almost fast, and rebel and disobey, you needn't
look for any sympathy from her! Colonel Ashendyne had
been explicit enough back in January. "When you send about
his business that second-rate person you've chosen to entangle
yourself with, then and not till then will you be 'Gipsy'
again to me!"</p>

<p>Hagar put out her arms to the wind. "I want to go away!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
I want to go away! I'm tired of it all&mdash;tired of living
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>The wind blew past her with its long cry; then it suddenly
sank, and there came almost a half-hour of bright calm, warm
stillness, astral gold. Hagar sat down between the roots of
the cucumber tree and took her head within her arms. By
degrees, in the sunshine, emotion subsided; she began to think
and dream. Her mind sent the shuttle far and fast, it touched
here and touched there, and in the course of its weaving it
touched Eglantine, touched and quit and touched again.
Laydon was still at Eglantine. He had been a very satisfactory
Professor of Belles-Lettres; Mrs. LeGrand really did not
know where, in mid-season, to find such another. He had
behaved wretchedly, but the mischief was done, and there
was&mdash;on consideration&mdash;no need to tell the world about it,
no especial need, indeed, of proclaiming it at Eglantine or to
Eglantine patrons at large. He was not&mdash;Mrs. LeGrand
did him that justice&mdash;he was not at all a "fast" man or
likely to give further trouble upon this line. And he was a
good teacher, a good talker, in demand for lectures on cultural
subjects before local literary societies, popular and pleasing,
a creditable figure among the Eglantine faculty. Much
of this matter was probably Hagar's fault. She had made
eyes at him, little fool! When the Colonel declared his
determination,&mdash;with no reflections on Eglantine, my dear
friend!&mdash;to bring to an end his granddaughter's formal education,
and to take her back to Gilead Balm where this
infatuation would soon disappear,&mdash;Mrs. LeGrand saw daylight.
She had an interview with Colonel Ashendyne. He
was profoundly contemptuous of what Mr. Laydon did for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
living or where he did it, of whom he taught or what he
taught, so long as there was distance between him and an
Ashendyne. "You know&mdash;you know, my dear friend, that
I have always had in mind Ralph Coltsworth!" She had an
interview&mdash;concert pitch&mdash;with Laydon. She had a smooth,
quiet talk with her teachers. She mentioned casually, to one
after another of the girls, that Mrs. Ashendyne at Gilead
Balm was not as young as she had been, nor as strong, and
that Colonel Ashendyne thought that Hagar should be at
home with her grandmother. She, Mrs. LeGrand, regretted
it, but every girl's duty to her family was paramount. They
would miss Hagar sadly,&mdash;she was a dear girl and a clever
girl,&mdash;but it seemed right that she should go. Hagar went
and Laydon stayed, and without a word from any principal
in the affair, every girl at Eglantine knew that Mr. Laydon
had kissed Hagar, and that Hagar had said that she would
love him forever, and that Colonel Ashendyne was very
angry, and was probably keeping Hagar on bread and water
at that instant, and that it was all very romantic.... And
then at Eglantine examinations came on, and dreams of
Easter holiday, and after that of Commencement, and Mr.
Laydon taught with an entire correctness and an impassive
attitude toward all young ladies; and Miss Bedford, who had
been very bitter at first and had said things, grew amiable
again and reopened her Browning. The ripple smoothed out
as all things smoothed out at Eglantine. The place resumed
its pristine "sweetness." It was believed among the girls that
Mr. Laydon and Hagar "corresponded," but it was not certainly
known. Mr. Laydon wrapped himself in dignity as in a
mantle. As for Hagar, she had always been rather far away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Up on the ridge to-day, Hagar's mind dwelt somewhat on
Eglantine, but not overmuch. It was not precisely Eglantine
that she was missing. Was she missing Laydon? Certainly,
at this period, she would have answered that she was&mdash;though,
to be perfectly truthful, she might have added,
"But I do not think of that all the time&mdash;not nearly all the
time." She was unhappy, and on occasions her fancy brooded
over that night in the Eglantine parlour when he read of love,
and the flames became jewelled and alive, and she saw the
turret on the plain, "by the caper overrooted, by the gourd
overscored," and suddenly a warmth and light wrapped
them both. The warmth and light certainly still dwelt over
that scene and that moment. To a lesser extent it abided
over and around the next morning, the west porch, the syringa
alley. Very strangely, as she was dimly aware, it
stretched only thinly over the following days, over even the
night of "Romeo and Juliet." There was there a mixed and
wavering light, changing, for the hour that immediately followed,&mdash;the
hour when she faced her grandfather, and he
spoke with knives as he was able to do, when he laid his hands
upon her and said untrue and unjust things to Laydon,&mdash;into
an angry glow. That hour was bright and hot like a ruby.
How much was love, and how much outraged pride and a
burning sense of wrong, she was not skilled to know, nor
how much was actual chivalric defence of her partner in iniquity....
The parting interview, when she and Laydon, having
stood upon their rights, obtained a strange half-hour in
the Eglantine parlour&mdash;strange and stiff, with "Of course, if
I love you, I'll be faithful," repeated on her part some five
times, with, on his part, Byronic fervour, volcanic utterances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Had he not gone over them to himself afterwards, in his
homely, cheerfully commonplace room in the brown cottage
outside the Eglantine grounds? They had been fine; from
the point of view of Belles-Lettres they could not have been
bettered. He felt a glow as he recognized that fact, followed
by a mental shot at the great Seat of Learning where he
wished to be. "By George! that's the place I'm fitted for!
The man they've got isn't in the same class&mdash;".... The
parting interview&mdash;to the girl on the ridge a cloud seemed
to hang over that, a cloud that was here and there rose-flushed,
but just as often fading into grey. Hagar drove her
thoughts back to the first evening and the jewelled fire; that
was a clear, fair memory, innocent, rich and sincere. The
others had, so strangely, a certain pain and dulness.</p>

<p>She had a sturdy power of reaction against the melancholy
and the painful, and as to-day she could not, somehow, fix
her mind unswervingly upon the one clear hour, and the
others perplexed and hurt, her mind at last turned with decision
from any contemplation whatsoever of the round of
events which lay behind her presence here, in March, upon
the ridge behind Gilead Balm. Rising, she left the cucumber
tree and walked along the crest of the ridge. The wind
was not blowing now, the sunshine was very golden, the little
leaves were springing. She crossed the ribbon-like plateau to
its northern edge, and stood, looking down that slope. It
was somewhat heavily wooded, and in shadow. It fell steeply
to a handsbreadth of sward, a purling streamlet, sunken boulders,
a wide thicket and a wood beyond. Hagar, leaning
against a young beech, gazed down the shadowed stillness.
Her eyebrows lifted at their inner ends, lines came into her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
forehead, wistful markings about her lips. Sometimes when
she knew that she was quite alone she spoke aloud to her self.
She did this now. "I haven't been here since that day it
happened.... Six years.... I wonder if he ran away again,
or if he stayed there to the end. I wonder where he is now.
Six years...."</p>

<p>The wind rose and blew fiercely, rattling in the thicket and
bending every tree; then it sank again. Hagar leaned against
the trunk of the beech and thought and thought. As a child
she had been speculative, everywhere and all the time; with
youth had come dreams and imaginations, pushing the older
intense querying aside. Now of a sudden a leaf was turned.
She dreamed and imagined still, but the thinker within her
rose a step, gained a foot on the infinite, mounting stair.
Hagar began to brood upon the state of the world. "Black
and white stripes like a zebra.... How petty to clothe a man&mdash;a
boy he was then&mdash;like that, mark him and brand him,
until through life he sees himself striped black and white like
a zebra&mdash;on his dying bed, maybe, sees himself like that!
Vindictive. And the world sees him, too, like that, grotesque
and mean and awful, and it cannot cleanse his image in its
mind. It is foolish."</p>

<p>The wind roared again up and down the ridge. Hagar shivered
and began to move toward the warmer side; then halted,
turned, and came back to the beech. "I'll not go away until
the sun comes from under that cloud and the wind drops.
It's like leaving him alone in the thicket down there, in
the cold and shadow." She waited until the sun came out
and the wind dropped, then took her hand from the beech
tree and went away. Leaving the ridge, she came to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
overseer's house, hesitated a moment, then went and knocked
at the kitchen door.</p>

<p>"Come in!" called Mrs. Green, who was sitting by the
kitchen table, in the patch of sunlight before the window,
sewing together strips of bright cloth and winding them into
balls for a rag carpet. "You, Hagar? Come right in! Well,
March is surely going out like a lion!"</p>

<p>"It's so windy that the clouds are running like sheep,"
said Hagar. She took a small, split-bottom rocking-chair,
drew it near Mrs. Green, and began to wind carpet rags.
"Red and blue and grey&mdash;it's going to be a beautiful
carpet! Have you heard from Thomasine?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Green rose and took a letter from behind the clock.
"Read it. She's been to a theatre and the Eden Musée and
Brooklyn Bridge, and she's going to visit the Statue of
Liberty."</p>

<p>Hagar read five pages of lined notepaper, all covered with
Thomasine's pretty, precise writing. "She's having a good
time.... I wish I were there, too. I've never seen New
York."</p>

<p>"Never mind! You will one day," said Mrs. Green. "Yes,
Thomasine's having a good time. Jim was born generous."</p>

<p>"Is she really going to work if he can get her a place?"</p>

<p>"Yes, child, she is. Times seems to me to be gettin'
harder right along instead of easier. Girls have got to go
out in the world and work nowadays, just the same as
boys. I don't know as it will hurt them; anyway, they've
got to do it. Food an' clothes don't ask which sect you
belong to."</p>

<p>"Thomasine ought to have gone to school. Girls can go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
college now, and Thomasine and I both ought to have gone
to college."</p>

<p>"Landsake!" said Mrs. Green. "Ain't you been to college
for going on three years?"</p>

<p>But Hagar shook her head. "No. Eglantine wasn't exactly
a college. I ought to have gone to a different kind of
place. Thomasine likes books, too."</p>

<p>"Yes, she likes them, but she don't like them nothing like
as much as you do. But Thomasine's a good child and
mighty refined. I hope Jim'll take pains to get her a place
where they are nice people. He means all right, but there!
men don't never quite understand."</p>

<p>"I wish I could earn money," said Hagar. "I wish I
could."</p>

<p>Mrs. Green regarded her over her spectacles. "A lot of
women have wished that, child. A lot of women have wished
it, and then again a lot of women haven't wished it. Some
would rather do for themselves an' for others an' some would
rather be did for, and that's the world. I've noticed it in
men, too."</p>

<p>"It's in my head all the time. I think mother put it
there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Mrs. Green. "A lot of us have felt
that way. But it ain't so easy for women to make money.
There's more ways they can't than they can. It's what they
call 'Sentiment' fights them. Sentiment don't mind their
being industrious, but it draws the line at their getting money
for it. It says it ought to be a free gift. It don't grudge&mdash;at
least it don't grudge much&mdash;a little egg and butter money,
but anything more&mdash;Lord!" She sewed together two strips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of blue flannel. "No, it ain't easy. And a woman kind of
gets discouraged. She's put her ambition to sleep so often
that now with most of them it seems asleep for keeps. Them
that's industrious don't expect to rise or anything to come of
it, and them that's lazy gets lazier. It's a funny world&mdash;for
women.&mdash;There's a lot of brown strips in the basket
there."</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell you what I've done," said Hagar, winding
a red ball. "I've written a fairy story&mdash;but I don't suppose
it will be taken."</p>

<p>"I always knew you could write," said Mrs. Green. "A
fairy story! What's it about?"</p>

<p>"About fairies and a boy and a girl, and a lovely land they
found by going neither north nor south nor east nor west, and
what they did there. It seemed to me right good," said
Hagar wistfully; "but I sent it off a month ago, and I've
never heard a word about it."</p>

<p>"Where did you send it? I never did know," said Mrs.
Green, "how what people writes gets printed and bound. It
don't do it just of itself."</p>

<p>Hagar leaned forward in her rocking-chair. Her cheeks
were carmine and her eyes soft and bright. "The 'Young
People's Home Magazine' offered three prizes for the three
best stories&mdash;stories that it could publish. And I thought,
'Why not I as well as another?'&mdash;and so I wrote a fairy
story and sent it. The first prize is two hundred dollars, and
the second prize is one hundred dollars, and the third is fifty
dollars.&mdash;If I could get even the third prize, I would be
happy."</p>

<p>"I should think you would!" exclaimed Mrs. Green.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
"Fifty dollars! I don't know as I ever saw fifty dollars all in
one lump&mdash;exceptin' war money. When are you going to
hear?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'm afraid I won't ever hear. I'm afraid
it wasn't good enough&mdash;not even good enough for them
to write to me and say it wouldn't do and tell me why."</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't give up hope," said Mrs. Green. "It's
my motto to carry hope right spang through the grave." She
rose, fed the fire, and filled the tea-kettle, then returned to her
rag carpet. "You're lookin' a little thin, child. Don't let
them worry you up at the house."</p>

<p>"I'm not," answered Hagar sombrely. The light went out
of her eyes. She stitched slowly, drawing her thread through
with deliberation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green again looked over her spectacles. "They're
mighty fine folk, the Ashendynes," she said at last. "They've
got old blood and pride for a dozen, and the settest heads!
Ain't nothin' daunts them, neither Satan nor the Lord.
They're goin' to run their own race.&mdash;You're more like
your mother, but I wouldn't say you didn't have something
of your grandfather in you at times. You've got a
dash of Coltsworth, too."</p>

<p>"Haven't I anything of my father at all?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Green, leaning forward into the sunlight, threaded
her needle. "I wouldn't be bitter about my father, if I were
you. People can be born without a sense of obligation and
responsibility just as they can be born without other senses.
I suppose it's there somewhere, only, so many other things
are atop, it ain't hardly ever stirred. Your father's right
rich in other things."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's so poor he couldn't either truly love my mother or
truly let her go.&mdash;But I didn't mean to talk about him,"
said Hagar. She laid the ball she had been winding in the
basket with the other balls and stood up, stretching her
young arms above her head. "Listen to the wind! I wish it
would blow me away, neither north nor south nor east nor
west!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you are like your mother," said Mrs. Green. "Have
you got to go? Then will you take your grandmother's big
knitting-needles back to her for me? And don't you want a
winesap?&mdash;there's a basket of them behind the door."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

THE LETTERS</h2>


<p>Miss Serena was playing "Silvery Waves." Hagar, kneeling
on the hearth-rug, warmed her hands at the fire and studied
the illuminated text over the mantel. "Silvery Waves" came
to an end, and Miss Serena opened the green music-book
at "Santa Anna's March."</p>

<p>"Has Isham gone for the mail?" asked Hagar.</p>

<p>"Yes. He went an hour ago.&mdash;You're hoping, I suppose,
for a letter from that dreadful man?"</p>

<p>"You know as well as I do," said Hagar, "that I gave my
word and he gave his to write only once a month. And he
isn't a dreadful man. He's just like everybody else."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Miss Serena, and brought her hands down
upon the opening chord. Hagar, her elbows on her knees, hid
her eyes in her hands. Within her consciousness Juliet was
speaking as she had spoken that night upon the stage&mdash;spoken
in the book&mdash;spoken in immortal life, youth, love.
Not so, she knew with a suddenness and clangour as of a falling
city, not so could Juliet have spoken! "Like everybody
else"&mdash;Was Laydon, then, truly, like everybody else?&mdash;A
horror of weakness and fickleness came over her. Was
there something direfully wrong with her nature, or was it
possible for people simply to be mistaken in such a matter?
Her head grew tired; she was so unhappy that she wished
to creep away and weep and weep.... Miss Serena, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
marched with Santa Anna, turned a dozen pages and began
"The Mocking Bird. With Variations."</p>

<p>Old Miss's step was heard in the hall, very firm and authoritative.
In a moment she entered the room, portly, not perceptibly
aged, her hair, beneath her cap, hardly more than
powdered with grey, still wearing black stuff gowns and white
aprons and heelless low shoes over white stockings. Hagar
rose from the rug and pushed the big chair toward the fire.</p>

<p>Old Miss dropped into it&mdash;no, not "dropped"&mdash;lowered
herself with dignity. "Has Isham brought the mail?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet."</p>

<p>"I dreamed last night that there was a letter from Medway.
Serena!"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother?"</p>

<p>"The next text you paint I want you to do one for me.
<i>Honour thy father and mother that thy days may be long</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Serena turned on the piano-stool. "I'll do it right
away, mother. It would be lovely in blue and gold....
You can't say that I haven't honoured father and mother."</p>

<p>Old Miss had drawn out her knitting and now her needles
clicked. "No one honours them as they used to be honoured.
No one obeys them as they used to obey. To-day children
think that they are wiser than their fathers. They set up
to use their own judgment until it's a scandal.... It's true
you've been better than most, Serena. Taking you year in
and year out, you've obeyed the commandment. It's more
than many daughters and grand-daughters that I know
have done." Her needles clicked again. "Yes, Serena, you
haven't given us much trouble. You were easy to make
mind from the beginning." She gave the due praise, but her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
tone was not without acerbity. It might almost have seemed
that such forthright ductility and keeping of the commandment
as had been Miss Serena's had its side of annoyance
and satiety.</p>

<p>Hagar spoke from the window where she stood, her forehead
pressed against the glass. "I see Isham down the road,
by the Half-Mile Cedar."</p>

<p>Old Miss turned the heel of the Colonel's sock she was knitting.
"Things that from the newspaper and my personal
observation happen now in the world could not possibly
have occurred when I was young. People defying their betters,
women deserting their natural sphere, atheists denying
hell and saying that the world wasn't made in six days,
young girls talking about independence and their own lives&mdash;their
own lives! Ha!"</p>

<p>Miss Serena began to play "The Sea in the Shell." "We
all know how Hagar came by her disposition, but I must say
it is an unfortunate one! When I was her age, no money
could have made me act as she has done."</p>

<p>"No money could have made me, either," spoke Hagar at
the window.</p>

<p>"Money has nothing to do with it!" said Old Miss. "At
least as far as Hagar is concerned, nothing! But fitness,
propriety, meekness, and modesty, consultation with those
to whom she owes duty, and bowing to what they say&mdash;all
those have something to do with it! But what could you
expect? It was bound to come out some day. From a bush
with thorns will come a bush with thorns."</p>

<p>"Here is Isham," said Hagar. "If you've said enough for
to-day, grandmother, shall I get the mail?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>She brought the bag to her grandmother. When the
Colonel was at home, no one else opened the small leather
pouch and distributed its contents; when he was away Old
Miss performed the ceremony. To-day he had mounted
Selim and ridden to the meeting in the neighbouring town.
Mrs. Ashendyne opened the bag and sorted the mail. There
was no great amount of it, but&mdash;"I said so! I dreamed it.
My dreams often come true. There it is!" "It" was a square
letter, quite thick, addressed in a rather striking hand and
bearing a foreign stamp and postmark. It was addressed to
the Colonel, and Mrs. Ashendyne never opened the Colonel's
letters&mdash;not even when they were from Medway. They were
not from him very often. The last, and that thin between
the fingers, had been in September. This one was so much
thicker than that one! Old Miss gazed at it with greedy eyes.</p>

<p>Miss Serena, too, leaving the piano-stool, came to her
mother's side and fingered the letter. "He must have had a
lot to write about. From Paris.... I used to want to go to
Paris so much!"</p>

<p>"Put it on the mantelpiece," said Old Miss. "It can't
be long before the Colonel's home." Even when it was on
the mantel-shelf she still sat looking at it with devouring
eyes. "I dreamed it was coming&mdash;and there it is!" The
remainder of the mail waited under her wrinkled hand.</p>

<p>Miss Serena grew mildly impatient. "What else is there,
mother? I'm looking for a letter about those embroidery
silks. There it is now, I think!" She drew from her mother's
lap an envelope with a printed return address in the upper
left-hand corner. "No, it isn't it. 'Young People's Home
Magazine.' Some advertisement or other&mdash;people pay a lot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to tell people about things they don't want! <i>Miss Hagar
Ashendyne.</i> Here, Hagar! It evidently doesn't know that
you are grown up&mdash;or think you are! There's my letter,
mother,&mdash;under the 'Dispatch.'"</p>

<p>Hagar went away with the communication from the
"Young People's Home Magazine" in her hand. She went
upstairs to her own room. It had been her mother's room.
She slept in the four-poster bed on which Maria had died, and
she curled herself with a book in the corner of the flowered
chintz sofa as Maria had done before her. She curled herself
here to-day, though with the letter, not with a book. The
letter lay upon her knees. She looked at it with a fixed countenance,
hardly breathing. She had thought herself out of a
deal of the conventional and materialized religious ideas of
her world&mdash;not out of religion but out of conventional
religion. She did not often pray now for rewards or benefits,
or hiatuses in the common law, or for a salvation external to
her own being. But at this moment the past reasserted itself.
Her lips moved. "O God, let it have been taken! O God,
let it have been taken! Let me have won the fifty dollars!
Let me have won the third prize. O God, let it have been
taken!"</p>

<p>At last, her courage at the sticking-point, she opened the
envelope, and unfolded the letter within. The typewritten
words swam before her eyes, the "Dear Madam," the page
or two that followed, the "With Congratulations, we are
faithfully yours." There was an enclosure&mdash;a cheque. She
touched it with trembling fingers. It said: "Pay to Miss
Hagar Ashendyne the Sum of Two Hundred Dollars."</p>

<p>An hour later, the dinner-bell sounding, she went downstairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
The Colonel and Captain Bob were yet at the meeting
of Democrats. There was to be a public dinner; they would
not be home before dusk. The three women ate alone, Dilsey
waiting. Old Miss was preoccupied; the letter on the parlour
mantelpiece filled her mind. "From Paris. In September
he was at a place called Dinard." Miss Serena had her
mind upon a panel&mdash;calla lilies and mignonette&mdash;which
she was painting for the rectory parlour. As for Hagar, she
did not talk much, nowadays, at Gilead Balm. If she were
more silent than usual to-day, it passed without notice.</p>

<p>Only once Old Miss remarked upon her appearance.
"Hagar, you've got a dazed look about the eyes. Are you
feeling badly?"</p>

<p>"No, grandmother."</p>

<p>"You're not to get ill, child. I shall make a bottle of
tansy bitters to-morrow morning. We've trouble enough in
this family without your losing colour and getting circles
round your eyes."</p>

<p>That was love and kindness from Old Miss. The water
came into Hagar's eyes. She felt a desire to tell her grandmother
and Aunt Serena about the letter, but in another moment
it was gone. Her whole inner life was by now secret
from them, and this seemed of the inner life. Presently, of
course, she would deliberately tell them all; she had thought
it out and determined that it would be after supper, before
Uncle Bob went to bed and grandfather told her to get the
chess-table. It seemed so wonderful a thing to her; she was so
awed by it that she could not help the feeling that it would
be wonderful to them, too.</p>

<p>In the afternoon she put a cape around her, left the home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
hill and went down the lane, skirted a ploughed field, and,
crossing the river road, came immediately to the fringe of
sycamores and willows upon the river bank. It was warmer
and stiller than it had been in the morning, for the voice of
the wind there sounded now the voice of the river; the many
boughs above were still against the sky. She made for a great
sycamore that she had known from childhood; it had a vast
protuberant curving root in whose embrace you could sit as
in an armchair. She sat there now and looked at the river
that went so swiftly by. It was swollen with the spring
rains; it made a deep noise, going by to the distant sea. To
Hagar its voice to-day was at once solemn and jubilant,
strong and stirred from depth to surface. She had with her
the letter; how many times she had read it she could not
have told. She could have said it by heart, but still she
wanted to read it, to touch it, to become aware of meaning
under meaning.... She could write, she could tell stories,
she could write books.... She could earn money. It was
one of the moments of her life: the moment when she knew
of her mother's death&mdash;the moment when she changed Gilead
Balm for Eglantine&mdash;the moment by the fire, Christmas
eve&mdash;this moment. She was but eighteen; the right-angled
turns in her road of this life had not been many; this
was one and a main one. Suddenly, to herself, her life
achieved purpose, direction. It was as though a rudderless
boat had been suddenly mended, or a bewildered helmsman
had seen the pole star.</p>

<p>She sat in the embrace of the sycamore, her feet lightly
resting on the spring earth, her shoulders just touching the
pale bark of the tree, her arms folded, her eyes level; poised,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
recollected as a young Brahman, conscious of an expanded
space, a deeper time. How long she sat there she did not
know; the sun slipped lower, touched her knees with gold.
She sighed at last, raised her hands and turned her body.</p>

<p>What, perhaps, had roused her was the sound of a horse's
hoofs upon the river road. At any rate, she now marked a
black horse coming in the distance, down the road, by the
speckled sycamores. It came on with a gay sound upon the
wind-dried earth, and in its rider she presently recognized her
cousin, Ralph Coltsworth.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" she asked when he reined in
the black horse beside her. "Why aren't you at the University
with Blackstone under your arm?"</p>

<p>He dismounted, fastened his horse, and came across to the
sycamore root. "It's big enough for two, isn't it?" he asked,
and sat down facing her. "You mentioned the University?
The University, bless its old heart! doesn't appreciate me."</p>

<p>"Ralph! Have you been expelled?"</p>

<p>"Suspended." Hands behind head, he regarded first the
blue sky behind the interlaced bare branches, then the tall
and great gnarled trunk, then the brown-clad figure of his
cousin, enthroned before him. "The suspense," he said, "is
exquisite."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>He grimaced. "I don't remember. Why talk about it?
It wasn't much. Cakes and ale&mdash;<i>joie de vivre</i>&mdash;chimes at
midnight&mdash;same old song." He laughed. "I gather that
you've been rusticated, too."</p>

<p>Hagar winced. "Don't!... Let's laugh about other
things. You'll break your family's hearts at Hawk Nest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Old Miss said in a letter which mother showed me
that you were breaking hers. What kind of a fellow is he,
Hagar?&mdash;Like me?"</p>

<p>Hagar looked at him gravely. "Not in the least. How
long are you going to stay at Hawk Nest?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a month! I'm coming to see you every other day."</p>

<p>"Are you?"</p>

<p>"I am. If I could draw I'd like to draw you just as you
look now&mdash;half marquise, half dryad&mdash;sitting before your
own front door!"</p>

<p>"Well, you can't draw," said Hagar. "And it's getting
cold, and the dryad is going home."</p>

<p>"All right," said Ralph. "I'm going, too. I've come to
spend the night."</p>

<p>Leading his horse, he walked beside her. In the green lane,
a wintry sunset glory over every slope and distant wood, the
house between its black cedars rising before them, he halted
a moment. "I haven't seen you since August when I rode
over to tell Gilead Balm good-bye. You've changed. You've
'done growed.'"</p>

<p>"That may be. I've grown to-day."</p>

<p>"Since I came?"</p>

<p>"No. Before you came. For the first time I suppose in
your life, grandmother is going to be sorry to see you. She
worships you."</p>

<p>"She was sorry to see you, too, wasn't she? It's rather
nice to be companions out of favour."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Hagar. "You are and always were the most
provoking twister of the truth! I want to say to you that I
do not consider that ours are similar cases! And now, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
please, that is the last word I am going to say to you on such
a matter."</p>

<p>"All right!" said Ralph. "I was curious, of course. But
I acknowledge your right to shut me up."</p>

<p>They passed through the home gate,&mdash;where a boy took
his horse,&mdash;and went up the hill together. Dilsey was lighting
the lamps. As they entered the hall Miss Serena came
out of the library&mdash;Miss Serena looking curiously agitated.
"Dilsey, hasn't Miss Hagar come in yet?... Oh, Hagar!
I've been searching the place for you&mdash;Why, Ralph!
Where on earth did you come from? Has the University
burned down? Have you got a holiday?"</p>

<p>The library door was ajar. The Colonel's voice made itself
heard from within. "Serena! Is that Hagar? Tell her
to come here."</p>

<p>The three entered the room together. There was a slight
clamour of surprise and greeting from its occupants for
Ralph, but it died down in the face, as it were, of things of
greater importance.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked, bringing up at last by
Captain Bob in the background.</p>

<p>"A letter from Medway," answered the other. "<i>Shh!</i>"</p>

<p>The evenings falling cold, there was a fire upon the hearth.
The reading-lamp was lit; all the room was in a glow that
caressed the stiff portraits, the old mahogany and horsehair
furniture, the bookcases and the books within. In the
smaller of the two great chairs by the hearth sat Old Miss,
preternaturally straight, her hands folded on the black silk
apron which she donned in the evening, her still comely face
and head rising from the narrow, very fine embroidered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
collar fastened by an oval brooch in which, in a complicated
pattern, was wrought the hair of dead Coltsworths and Hardens.
Her face wore a look at once softened and fixed. Across
from her, in the big chair by the leaf-table, sat Colonel Ashendyne,
a little greyer, a little more hawklike of nose, a little
sparer in frame as the years went by, but emphatically not a
person to whom could be applied the term "old." There
breathed from him still an insolent, determined prime, a
timelessness, a pictorial quality as of some gallery masterpiece.
With the greyish-amber of his yet plentiful hair, his
mustache and imperial, the racer set of his head, his well-shaped
jaw and long nervous hands, his fine, long, spare
figure and his eye in which a certain bladelike keenness and
cynicism warred with native sensuousness, he stayed in the
memory like such a canvas. His mood always showed
through him, though somewhat cloudily like light through
a Venetian glass. That it was a mixed and curious mood to-night,
Hagar felt the moment she was in the room. She did
not always like her grandfather, but she usually understood
him. She saw the letter that had rested on the mantelpiece,
the letter from Paris, in his hand, and at once there came
over her a curious foreboding, she did not know whether of
good or evil.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said the Colonel. "I have something to read
to you."</p>

<p>For two months and more he had not looked at her without
anger in his eyes. To-night the cloud seemed at least
partly to have gone by. There was even in the Colonel's
tone a touch of blandness, of enjoyment of the situation.
She sat down, wondering, her eyes upon the letter. On occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
when she searched her heart through, she found but a
shrivelled love for her father. Except that he had had half-share
in giving her life, she really did not know what she had
to love him for. Now, however, what power of growth there
was in the winter-wrapped root broke the soil. She began to
tremble. "What is the matter? Is father ill? Is he coming
home?"</p>

<p>"Not immediately," said the Colonel. "No, he is not ill.
He appears to be in his usual health and to exhibit his
usual good spirits. Your grandmother and I were fortunate
in having a son of a disposition so happy that he left all
clouds and difficulties, including his own, to other people.
At the proper moment he has always been able to find a
burden-bearer. No, Medway is well, and apparently happy.
He has remarried."</p>

<p>"Remarried!..."</p>

<p>It was the Colonel's intention to read her the letter&mdash;indeed,
it carried an inclosure for her&mdash;as he had already read
it, twice, with varying comment, to the others assembled.
But he chose to make first, his own introduction. "You've
heard of the cat that always falls on its feet? Well, that's
your father, Gipsy!"&mdash;Even in the whirl of the moment
Hagar could not but note that he called her "Gipsy."&mdash;"That's
Medway! Here's a careless, ungrateful, disobedient
son, utterly reckless of his obligations. Is he hanged
or struck by lightning? Not he! He goes happily along&mdash;Master
Lucky-Dog! He makes a disastrous marriage with
a penniless remnant of a broken-down family on some lost
coast or other and brings her home, and presently there's a
child. Does he undertake to support them, stay by his bargain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
however poor a one? Not he! He's got a tiny income
in his own right, left him by his maternal grandfather&mdash;just
enough, with care, for one! Off he goes with that in his
pocket and a wealthy friend and, from that day to this, we
haven't laid eyes on Prince Fortunatus! Well, what happens?
Does he come to eating husks with the swine and so at last
slink back! Not he! He enjoys life; he's free and footloose;
he's put his burden on other folk's backs! Death comes along
and unmakes his marriage. His doting mother and his weak
father apparently are prepared to charge themselves with the
maintenance of his child. Why should he trouble? He
doesn't&mdash;not in the least! He's got just enough in his own
right to let him wander, <i>en garçon</i>, over creation. If he took
the least care of another he couldn't wander, and he likes to
wander. Ah, I understand Medway, from hair to heel!&mdash;What
comes of it all? We used to believe in Nemesis, but
that, like other beliefs, is going by the board. Isn't he going
to suffer? Not at all! He remains the cat that falls, every
time, upon its feet.&mdash;This, Gipsy, is the letter."</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>My dear Father and Mother:&mdash;As well as I can remember,
I was staying at Dinard when I last wrote you. I was there
because of the presence in that charming place of a lady whose
acquaintance I had made, the previous year, at Aix-les-Bains.
From Dinard I followed her, in November, to Nice, and from
Nice to Italy. I spent a portion of February as her guest in her
villa near Sorrento, and there matters were brought to a conclusion.
I proposed marriage and she accepted. We were married
a week ago in Rome, in the English church, before a large
company, the American Minister giving her away. There were</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
<i>matters to be arranged with her banker and lawyer in Paris, and
so, despite the fact that March is a detestable month in this city,
we immediately came on here. Later we shall be in Brittany,
and we talk of Norway for the summer.</i></p>

<p><i>The lady whom I have married was the widow of &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;,
the noted financier and railroad magnate. She is something
under my own age, accomplished, attractive, handsome, and
possessed of a boundless good nature and a benevolent heart. We
understand each other's nature and expect to be happy together.
I need hardly tell you that being who she is, she has extreme
wealth. If you read the papers&mdash;I do not&mdash;you may perhaps
recall that &mdash;&mdash;'s will left his millions to her absolutely without
condition. There were no children. To close this matter:&mdash;she
has been generous to a degree in insisting that certain settlements
be made&mdash;it leaves me with a personal financial independence
and assurance of which, of course, I never dreamed.... I have
often regretted that I have been able to do so little for you, or for
the upkeep of dear old Gilead Balm. This, in the future, may be
rectified. I understand that you have had to raise money upon
the place, and I wish you would let me know the amount.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The Colonel's eyes darted cold fire. He let the sheet fall
for the moment and turned upon Hagar, sitting motionless
on the ottoman by the fire. "Damn your father's impertinence,
Gipsy!" he said.</p>

<p>Old Miss spoke in a soft and gentle voice. "Why do you
call it that, Colonel? Medway always had a better heart
than he's ever been given credit for. Why shouldn't he help
now that he can do so? It's greatly to his credit that he
should write that way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sarah," said the Colonel, "you are a soft-hearted&mdash;mother!"</p>

<p>Captain Bob spoke from beyond the table. Captain Bob
did not often speak, nor often with especial weight, but he
had been pondering this matter for three quarters of an hour,
and he had a certain kind of common sense. "I think Sarah's
right. Medway's a curiosity to me, but I've always held
that he was born that way. You are, you know; you're born
so or you aren't born so. He's pretty consistent. There
never was a time when I wouldn't have said that he would
come to the fore just as soon as he didn't have to deny himself.
Now the time's come, and here he is. I think Sarah's
right. Forgive and forget! If he wants to pay his debts&mdash;and
God knows he owes you and Sarah a lot&mdash;I'd let him.
And as to Gipsy there&mdash;better late than never! Read her
what he says."</p>

<p>"I am going to," said the Colonel sardonically. He read the
page that remained, then laid the letter on the table, put
his hands behind his head and regarded his granddaughter.
"The benevolent parent arrived at last upon the scene&mdash;a
kindly disposed stepmother with millions&mdash;and that teacher
of surface culture to young ladies at Eglantine! Among the
three you ought to be quite ideally provided for! I hope
Medway will like the teacher."</p>

<p>Old Miss came, unexpectedly, to her granddaughter's aid.
"Don't worry her, Colonel! I haven't thought her looking
well to-day. Give her her letter, and let her go and think it
out quietly by herself.&mdash;If you like, child, Ph&oelig;be shall
bring you your supper."</p>

<p>Hagar did like&mdash;oh, would like that, thank you, grandmother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
very much! She took the letter&mdash;it was addressed
to her in a woman's hand&mdash;which her father had enclosed
and which her grandfather now held out to her, and went
away, feeling somewhat blindly for the door, leaving the
others staring after her. Upstairs she lit her lamp and
placed it on Maria's table, by Maria's couch. Then, curled
there, against the chintz-covered pillows,&mdash;they were in a
pattern of tulips and roses,&mdash;she read the very kind letter
which her stepmother had written.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

A MEETING</h2>


<p>The New Springs had been so christened about a hundred
years before, when a restless pioneer family had moved westward
and upward from the Old Springs, thirty miles away,
at the foot of the great forest-clad range. The New Springs
had been a deer-lick, and apparently, from the number of
arrowheads forever being unearthed, a known region to the
Indians. Now the Indians were gone, and the deer fast, fast
withdrawing. Occasionally buck or doe was shot, but for
the most part they were phantoms of the past. So with the
bear who used to come down to the corncribs in the lonely
clearings. Bear Mountain still rose dark blue, like a wall,
and the stark cliff called Bear's Den caught the first ray of
the sun, but the bears themselves were seldom seen. They
also were phantoms of the past. But the fish stayed in the
mountain streams. There were many streams and many fish,&mdash;bright,
speckled mountain trout, darting and flashing
among pools and cascades, now seen in the sunlight, now
lurking by fern-crowned rocks, in the shadow of the dark
hemlock spruce. The region was Fisherman's Paradise.</p>

<p>It was almost an all-day's climb from the nearest railway
station to the New Springs. You took the stage in the first
freshness of the morning; you went gaily along for a few miles
through a fair grazing country; then the stage began to climb,
and it climbed and climbed until you wondered where and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
when the thing was going to stop. Every now and then
driver and passengers got down and walked. Here it was
shady, with wonderful banks of rhododendron, with ferns and
overhanging trees, and here it was sunny and hot, with the
wood scrub or burned, and the only interesting growth huckleberries
and huckleberries and huckleberries, dwarf under
the blazing sun, with butterflies flitting over them. Up here
you had wonderful views; you saw a sea of mountains, tremendous,
motionless waves; the orb as it had wrinkled when
man and beast and herb were not. At last, somewhere on the
long crest, having been told that you must bring luncheon
with you and having provided yourself at the railway station
with cold bread and fruit and hard-boiled eggs, you had
luncheon. It was eaten near a bubbling spring with a water-trough
at which the horses were drinking, and eaten with
the most tremendous appetite. By now you were convinced
that the air up here was blowing through a champagne
bottle. Luncheon over and the horses rested, on went the
stage. Quite in the mid-afternoon you began to go down the
mountain. Somewhat later, in a turn by a buckwheat field
waving white in the summer wind, the driver would point
with his whip&mdash;"Right down there&mdash;there's the New
Springs! Be there in an hour now."</p>

<p>It might be "right down there," but still the New Springs
was pretty high in the world, away, away above sea level.
You always slept at the New Springs under blankets, you
nearly always had a fire in the evening; even the heat of the
midday sun in the dog days was only a dry, delightful
warmth. Hardly anywhere did the stars shine so brightly,
the air was so rare and fine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The New Springs boasted no imposing dwellings. There
was a hotel, of faint, old, red brick, with a pillared verandah,
and there were half a dozen one-story frame cottages, each
with a small porch and growing over it its individual vine.
Honeysuckle clambered over one, and hops over another,
and a scarlet bean over a third, and so on. There was an
ice-cold sulphur spring where the bubbles were always rising,
and around it was built a rustic pavilion. Also there
existed a much-out-of-repair bowling-alley.</p>

<p>"Yes, there's the New Springs," said the driver, pointing
with his whip. "But, Lord! it stopped being new a long
time ago."</p>

<p>There were hardly any passengers to-day; only three in
fact: two women and a man. All three were young enough to
accomplish with enjoyment a great deal of walking up the
long mountain. They had laughed and talked together,
though of very nothings as became just-met folk. The birds
and the bees and butterflies, the flowers, the air, and the view
had been the chief subjects of comment. Now, back in the
stage for the descent, they held in their hands flowers and
ferns and branches covered with ripe huckleberries which
they detached from the stems, lifted to their lips and ate.
The two women were friends, coming, so they now explained
to their fellow-traveller, from a distance to this
little out-of-the-way place. The brother of one, it seemed,
was a great fisherman and came often. He was not here
this year; he was travelling in Palestine; but he had advised
his sister, who was a little broken down and wanted a
quiet place to work in, to come here. She said, jubilantly,
that if the air was always going to be like this she was glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
she had come. It had seemed funny, at first, to think of
coming South for the summer&mdash;though her friend was
half-Southern and didn't mind.</p>

<p>"I'm wondering," said the fellow-traveller, with an effect
of gallantry, "what in the world the work can be! The very
latest thing, I suppose, in fancy-work&mdash;or perhaps you do
pastels?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth Eden looked at him with her very candid grey
eyes. "I'm doing a book of statistics&mdash;women and children
in industry."</p>

<p>"And I," said the other, Marie Caton, "I teach English
to immigrant girls. We are both Settlement workers."</p>

<p>Laydon prided himself on his ability quickly to shift sail.
"Oh!" he said; "a Settlement! That's an idea that hasn't
got down to us yet. We are rather lazy, I suppose.&mdash;I was
reading, though, an excellent article upon Settlements in
one of the current magazines only the other day. Ladies,
especially, seem to be going in for that kind of work;&mdash;of
course, it is, when you think of it, only an extension of their
historic function as 'loaf-giver.' Charity and Woman&mdash;they're
almost synonymous."</p>

<p>"That's a magnificent compliment&mdash;or meant to be!"
said Marie Caton. Her eyes were dancing. "I wonder what
you'd say if I said that charity&mdash;charity in your sense&mdash;is
one of woman's worst weaknesses? Thank God Settlements,
bad as they are, aren't charity!"</p>

<p>"Look at the view, Marie," said Elizabeth. "And, oh!
feel that wind! Isn't it divine?"</p>

<p>"Winds blow from all four points at oncet up here," said
the driver. "Ain't many people at the New Springs this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
summer. Fish don't bite, or everybody's gone to the World's
Fair, or something or other! Ain't more'n forty people,
countin' children."</p>

<p>"What kind of people are they? Do the women fish, too?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, not much. It's the husbands and brothers
and fathers does the fishing mostly&mdash;though there's Mrs.
Josslyn. <i>She</i> fishes. The others just sit around in rocking-chairs,
I reckon, and crochet. Them that has children looks
after them, and them that hasn't listens to them that has.
Then it's a fine air for the health; fine air and fine water. A
lot of tired people come. Then there's others get into the
habit of meeting friends here. Being on the border, as it
were, it's convenient for more states than one. Colonel Ashendyne,
for instance,&mdash;he comes because General Argyle
and Judge Black and he made a pact in the war that if they
lived through they'd spend a month together every two
years until they died. They've kept it faithful, and because
Judge Black's a great fisherman, and General Argyle likes
the juleps they make here, and Colonel Ashendyne knew the
place when he was a boy, they pitched on the New Springs.
When they're here together, they're the three Kings.&mdash;Git
up thar, Dandy!&mdash;This year the Colonel's got his daughter
and granddaughter with him."</p>

<p>Laydon nodded, looking animated and handsome. "I
know the Ashendynes. Indeed&mdash;but that is neither here nor
there. The Ashendynes," he explained for the benefit of the
two foreigners, "are one of our oldest families, with connections
everywhere; not wealthy,&mdash;we have very little wealth,
you know,&mdash;but old, very widespread and honoured. A
number of them in the past were really famous. It might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
said of the Ashendynes as it was said of an English family&mdash;'All
the sons were brave and all the daughters virtuous.'"</p>

<p>"You seem," said Marie Caton, "to have a profound
acquaintance with the best literature."</p>

<p>Laydon disclaimed it with a modest shake of the head.
"Oh, only so-so! However, literature is my profession. I
have a chair of Belles-Lettres."</p>

<p>"That is interesting," said Elizabeth in her friendly voice.
"Is it your vacation? Are you a fisherman, too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I fish a little on occasion! But I am not what you
call a great fisherman. And I was never at the New Springs
before." He gave a half-boyish, embarrassed laugh. "To
tell the truth, I am one of those persons who've come because
another person happens to be here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Marie Caton, "I see!" She began presently
to hum beneath her breath&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"Gin a body meet a body,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Comin' through the rye&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Oh, what a rough piece of road!"</p>

<p>"It ain't often mended," said the driver. "They say
times is changing,&mdash;there was a fellow through here last
summer said they was changing so rapid they made you
dizzy,&mdash;but there ain't much change gotten round to Bear
Mountain. I remember that identical rut there when I was
just a little shaver.&mdash;Look out, now, on that side, and
you'll see the New Springs again! We ain't more'n a mile
an' a half away now. The ladies often walk up here to see
the sunset."</p>

<p>"There's one coming up the road now," said Marie Caton,
"In a green gingham and a shady hat."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"That," said the driver, "'ll be Miss Hagar&mdash;Colonel
Ashendyne's granddaughter. She and me's great friends.
Come by here 'most any evenin' and you'll find her sittin'
on the big rock there, lookin' away to Kingdom Come."</p>

<p>"Stop a minute," spoke Laydon, "and let me out here. I
know Miss Ashendyne. I'll wait here to meet her and walk
back to the Springs with her."</p>

<p>He lifted his hat to his fellow-travellers and the stage went
on without him. "A nice, clean-looking man," said Elizabeth
who was inveterate at finding good; "not very original,
but then who is?"</p>

<p>"I can't answer it," said Marie promptly. "Now we'll
see the girl! She's coming up straight and light, like a right
mountain climber." The stage met and passed Hagar, she
and the driver exchanging "Good-evenings!" The stage
lumbered on down the slope. "I liked her looks," said Marie.
"Now, they're meeting&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't look back."</p>

<p>"All right, I won't. I'd like such consideration myself.&mdash;Betsy,
Betsy! You are going to get strong enough at the
New Springs to throw every statistic between Canada and
Mexico!"</p>

<p>Back beside the big rock at the bend of the road, Hagar
and Laydon met. "There isn't any one to see!" he exclaimed,
and would have taken her in his arms.</p>

<p>She evaded his grasp, putting out her hand and a light
staff which she carried. "No, Mr. Laydon! Wait&mdash;wait&mdash;"
Stepping backward to the rock by the wayside she sat down
upon it, behind her all the waves of the Endless Mountains.
"I only got your letter yesterday. It had been delayed. If I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
had had it in time, I should have written to you not to
come."</p>

<p>"I told you in it," smiled Laydon, "that I was not afraid
of your grandfather. He can't eat me. The New Springs is
as much mine to come to as it is his. I had just three days
before I go to &mdash;&mdash; to see about that opening there. The
idea came to me that if I could really see him and talk to him,
he might become reconciled. And then, dear little girl! I
wanted to see you! I couldn't resist&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he spoke he moved toward her again. She shook her
head and put out again the hand with the staff. "No. That
is over.... I came up here to meet you because I wanted to
find out&mdash;to know&mdash;to be certain, at once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To find out&mdash;to know&mdash;to be certain of what?" He
smiled. "That I am just the same?&mdash;That I love you
still?"</p>

<p>"To be certain," said Hagar, "that I was mistaken....
I have got my certainty."</p>

<p>"I wish," said Laydon, after a pause, "that I knew what
you were driving at. There was something in your last
month's letter, and for the matter of that in the month before,
that struck cold. Have I offended you in any way,
Hagar?"</p>

<p>"You have not been to blame," said Hagar. "I don't
think either of us was to blame. I think it was an honest
mistake. I think we took a passing lightning flash for the
sun in heaven.... Mr. Laydon, that evening in the parlour
at Eglantine and the morning after, when we walked to the
gate, and the road was sunny and lonely and the bells were
ringing, oh, then I am sure I loved you&mdash;" She drew her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
hand across brow and eyes. "Or, if not you, I loved&mdash;Love!
But after that, oh, steadily after that, it lessened&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Lessened'!&mdash;You mean that you are not in love with
me as you were?"</p>

<p>"I am not in love with you at all. I was in love with you,
or.... I was in love. I am not now." She struck her staff
against the rock. "I almost hope I'll never be in love
again!"</p>

<p>Across from a cleared hillside, steep and grassy, came a
tinkling of sheep-bells. The sun hung low in the west and
the trees cast shadows across the road. A vireo was singing
in a walnut tree, a chipmunk ran along a bit of old rail fence.
A zephyr brought an odour dank and rich, from the aged
forest that hung above.</p>

<p>"I think," said Laydon, "that you are treating me very
badly."</p>

<p>"Am I? I am sorry.... You mustn't think that I haven't
been wretched over all this. But it would be treating you
badly, indeed, if I were such a coward as to let it go on."
She looked at him oddly. "Will you be&mdash;Are you much
hurt?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;" said Laydon. "I do not think you quite conceive
what you are saying, nor what such a cool pronunciamento
must mean to a man! Hurt? Yes, I am hurt. My
pride&mdash;my confidence in you&mdash;my assurance that I had
your heart and that you had put your life in my keeping&mdash;the
love that I truly felt for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Felt.'&mdash;You loved me, loving you. Oh," said Hagar,
"I feel so old&mdash;so old!"</p>

<p>"I loved you sincerely. I imperilled my position for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
you&mdash;to a certain extent, all my prospects in life. I had
delightful visions of the day when we should be finally together&mdash;the
home you would make&mdash;the love and protection
I should give you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are honest," said Hagar, "and I like honesty. If I
have done you any wrong at all, if I have made life any harder
for you, if I have destroyed any ideals, if I have done you
the least harm, I very heartily beg your pardon."</p>

<p>Laydon drew from his pocket a small box and opened it.
"I had brought you that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hagar took it in her hand and looked at it. "It is lovely!"
she said. "A diamond and a sapphire! And it isn't going to
be wasted. You keep it. Sooner or later you'll surely need it.
You couldn't have bought a prettier one." She looked up
with a soft, bright, almost maternal face. "You don't know
how much happier I am having faced it, and said it, and
had it over with! And you&mdash;I don't believe you are so unhappy!
Now are you&mdash;now are you?"</p>

<p>"You have put me in an absurd position. What am I to
say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To people? Nothing&mdash;or what you please. I will tell
grandfather myself, to-night&mdash;and Aunt Serena. I shall
tell them that you have behaved extremely well, and that it
was all my fault. Or no! I shall tell them that we both
found out that we had been mistaken, for I think that that
is the truth. And that we have had an explanation, and are
now and for always just well-wishers and common friends and
nothing more. I am going to try&mdash;I think that now maybe
I can do it&mdash;to get grandfather to treat you properly. There
is nobody else here whose business it is, or who knows anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
about it&mdash;and you have only three days anyway.
There are some pleasant people, and you'll meet them. It
isn't going to be awkward, indeed, it isn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By George!" said Laydon, "if you aren't the coolest....
Of course, if this is the way you feel, it may be
wisest not to link my life with&mdash;Naturally a man wants
entire love, admiration, and confidence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just so," said Hagar. "And you'll find some one to feel
all that. And now let's walk to the New Springs."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

THE NEW SPRINGS</h2>


<p>Laydon's three days spun themselves out to five with a fine
smoothness. Colonel Ashendyne's tone was balm itself to
what it might have been. Miss Serena was willing to discuss
with him "In Memoriam" and the novels of Miss Broughton,
and Ralph Coltsworth who was also at the New Springs
walked with him over the place. Laydon was keen enough to
see that Hagar had appealed to her family, and that Ashendyne
breeding had rallied to her support. He was at once provoked
and soothed; now conscious only of the injury to his
healthy self-love, and now of a vague relief that, young as he
still was, and with that wonderful future all to make, he really
was not tied down. His very vanity would not agree but that
the woman with whom he had thought himself in love must be
of a superior type and an undeniable charm, but the same vanity
conceded gently that to err was mortal, and that there
were as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it, and that
he certainly had not been fatally smitten&mdash;on the whole, she,
poor little thing! had probably suffered the most of the two.
Charming as she was, the glamour for him, he conceded, was
gone. <i>He had come off pretty well, after all.</i></p>

<p>When the five days were up, he felt positive regret at having
to go, and his good-bye to all the Ashendynes was cordial.
He had already written to Mrs. LeGrand, and, of course, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
his mother. He went; the stage took him up the mountain....</p>

<p>"For all I could see&mdash;and I watched pretty closely&mdash;there
didn't anything come of it," remarked Marie Caton.
"On the whole, I am rather glad. Now you can't hear
the rumble of the stage any longer. He's gone out of the picture.&mdash;Betsy,
stop writing and look at the robin and the
chipmunk&mdash;"</p>

<p>They had the tiniest cottage to themselves&mdash;Elizabeth's
brother being an old-timer here, and his letter to the proprietor
procuring them great consideration. There were but
two rooms in the cottage. Roof and porch, it was sunk in
traveller's-joy, and in front sprang a vast walnut tree, and
beyond the walnut a span-wide stream purled between mint
over a slaty bed. From the porch you looked southward
over mountains and mountains, and every evening Antares
looked redly back at you. Now it was morning, and wrens
and robins and cat-birds all were singing.</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked up from the table where she was working.
"If I watch chipmunks all morning, I'll never get these
textile figures done.&mdash;Mrs. Josslyn said at breakfast that it
wasn't a good day for fishing, and that she might wander
by."</p>

<p>"She's coming now. I see her in the distance. I like
Molly Josslyn."</p>

<p>"So do I.&mdash;We haven't been here a week and yet we
talk as though we had known these people always!"</p>

<p>"Well, the fact that quite a number knew your brother
made for there being no ice to break. And it would be so
absurd not to know one another at the New Springs! as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
absurd as if a shipload of people cast on a desert island&mdash;Here
she is. Come in, Mrs. Josslyn!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I don't want a chair," said Molly Josslyn.
"You don't mind if I sit on the edge of the porch and dangle
my feet, do you? Nor if I take off my hat and roll up my
sleeves so that I can feel the air on my arms?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. Take the hairpins out of your hair and let it
fly."</p>

<p>"I wish that I could cut it off!" said Molly viciously. "I
will some day! Pretty nearly a whole three-quarters of an
hour out of every twenty-four gone in brushing and combing
and doing up hair! You have to do it in the morning and the
middle of the day and the evening. A twentieth part of your
whole waking existence!... Oh, me!"</p>

<p>"What a sigh!"</p>

<p>"I've been in rocking-chair-and-gossip land over on the
big porch. I've heard everybody&mdash;in a petticoat&mdash;who
wasn't there hanged, drawn, and quartered. Of course, I
knew they were eager to get at me, and so I was obliging and
came away."</p>

<p>Marie Caton laughed. "Miss Eden here is an optimist of
the first water. If you ask her she'll tell you that women are
growing beyond that sort of thing&mdash;that they don't sting
one another half as much as they used to!"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think they do," said Mrs. Josslyn. "I think
that's getting apparent nowadays. Speaking for myself,
fresh air and out of doors and swinging off by one's self
seem to make a body more or less charitable. But some of
us have got the habit yet. Gnat or wasp or hornet or snake,
on they go!" she laughed. "Over on the porch it wasn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
anything but a little cloud of gnats. They weren't really
stinging&mdash;just getting between your eyes and the blue
sky."</p>

<p>"But it is growing better&mdash;it is, it is!" said Elizabeth.
"I wouldn't give up that belief for anything."</p>

<p>"No, don't!" said Molly Josslyn. "I like women and like
to think well of them."</p>

<p>A strong, rosy blonde, she stood up and stretched her arms
above her head. "I wish there were a pool somewhere, deep
enough to swim in! I'd like to cross the Hellespont this
morning&mdash;swim it and swim back.&mdash;Christopher is coming
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Christopher?"</p>

<p>"My husband&mdash;Christopher Josslyn. They don't," said
Mrs. Josslyn, "make them any nicer than Christopher!
Christopher was my born mate." And went away with a
beamy look, over the grass.</p>

<p>Marie spoke thoughtfully. "Yesterday I heard one of the
gnats singing. It sang, 'Yes, rather handsome, but don't you
find her dreadfully unfeminine?'"</p>

<p>"Oh, 'feminine'!" said Elizabeth, and went on adding
figures.</p>

<p>Marie Caton took a book from the generous number
ranged around a jar of Black-eyed Susans on the rustic table
in the middle of the porch, but "The chipmunks and the
robins get so in the way," she presently dreamily murmured,
and then, "You had just as well put up your work. Here's
Judge Black and General Argyle!"</p>

<p>Judge Black was sixty-two, rather lean than stout, rather
short than tall, clean-shaven, with a good-looking countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
below grizzled, close-clipped hair, with a bald spot at
the top like a monk's tonsure. General Argyle was a much
larger and taller man, big-framed, wide-girthed, with a well-set
head framed about with shaggy white hair. His countenance
was rubicund, his voice mellow. He was sixty-seven, in
some respects very old, and in others quite young. Usually,
at the New Springs, Colonel Ashendyne marched in company,
but this morning&mdash;"Ashendyne's got some family conference
or other on hand. It's a day off for fishing, and nobody seems
to have a mind for whist or poker, and the papers haven't
come. Argyle and I are floating around like two lost corks
or the Babes in the Wood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So I said," said General Argyle richly, "let's stroll over
there and say good-morning to Tom Eden's sister and her
attractive friend.&mdash;No, no; no chairs! We'll sit here on the
steps. As soon as Ashendyne appears, we're going after
young Coltsworth and have a turn in the bowling-alley.
Must exercise!&mdash;that's what I'm always telling Black
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As if I didn't exercise," said Judge Black, "more in a
day than he does in a week.&mdash;What a pretty little porch
you've got! Books, flowers, needlework&mdash;"</p>

<p>The General surveyed it, too. "It <i>is</i> pretty. Woman's
touch&mdash;woman's touch!"</p>

<p>"That isn't needlework in the basket," said Marie demurely.
"It's apples. Will you have one?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks, Mistress Eve&mdash;or yes, on second thoughts,
I will! What are you reading?&mdash;'The Doll's House.'
Ibsen!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not know," said the Judge, "what young ladies are
coming to! I have never had time, nor, I may say, inclination,
to read Ibsen myself, but of course I know the kind of
thing he's responsible for. And, frankly, I should not permit
my daughter to read that book!"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Marie, "I don't think myself it is a book for a
child!"</p>

<p>"She's not a child. She's twenty-six. I should dissuade
my wife, too, from reading it."</p>

<p>"Then your wife," answered Marie, "would miss an illuminating
piece of literature."</p>

<p>Elizabeth came in with her serene voice. "Don't you
think, Judge Black, that we all acquire a habit of judging a
writer, whom we haven't yet had time to study for ourselves,
too much in terms of some review or other, or of the mere
unthinking, current talk? I think we all do it. I believe
when you read Ibsen you will feel differently about him."</p>

<p>"Not I!" said the Judge. "I have seen extracts enough.
I tell you, Miss Eden, the age is reading too much of such
decadent stuff&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, 'decadent'!"</p>

<p>"And it is read, amazingly, by women. I would rather
see my wife or daughter with the old dramatists at their
worst in their hands than with stuff like that&mdash;! Overturning
all our concepts, criticizing supremacies&mdash;I beg your
pardon, Miss Caton, but if you knew how women, nowadays,
amaze me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop hectoring, Black," said the General mellowly. "She's
not in the dock. Just so that women stay women, they can
fill their heads with what stuff they will&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Exactly!" said Judge Black. "Do you see them staying
women?"</p>

<p>"Women of the past," said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"That is woman,&mdash;the women of the past. There isn't
any other. The eternal feminine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think you are limiting the eternal and denying the universe
power to evolve," said Elizabeth. "Why not eternally
the man of the past? Why not 'There isn't any other'?
Why not 'The eternal masculine'? Why do you change and
grow from age to age?"</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure that they do," said Marie <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>"Yes, they do! They grow and become freer always;
though I think," said Elizabeth painfully, "that they lag in
the way they look at women.&mdash;Well, if you grow, being one
half, do you suppose that we are not going to grow, being the
other half? And if you think that the principle of growth is
not in us, still I shouldn't worry! If we can't grow, we
won't grow, and you needn't fash yourselves. On the other
hand, if we can, we will&mdash;and that is all there is about it.
And it wouldn't do you the least harm to read Ibsen&mdash;nor
to get another definition of 'decadent.'"</p>

<p>She leaned forward in her chair. "Do you see that strip of
blanched grass there?&mdash;or rather it was blanched yesterday
when that board over there was lying upon it and had lain,
I don't know how long!&mdash;blanched and bent and sicklied
over. Now look! It is getting colour and standing straight&mdash;only
beginning, but it is beginning&mdash;beginning to be on
terms with the sun! Well, that grass is woman to-day! The
heavy board is being lifted, and that's the change and all
the change&mdash;and you find it 'pernicious'!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Glowing-cheeked, she ceased speaking. Judge Black's
colour, too, had heightened. "My dear Miss Eden, how did
all this begin? I'm the last person in the world to deny to
woman a proper freedom. I only ask that it shan't go beyond
a certain point&mdash;that it shan't threaten the unsettling of a
certain divine <i>status quo</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I doubt if a divine <i>status quo</i> is ever unsettled, Judge
Black," said Elizabeth. "But there&mdash;but there!" She
smiled, and she had a very sweet, sunny smile. "I didn't in
the least mean to quarrel! Tom will have told you that I
sometimes use my tongue, and that's the ancient woman,
still, isn't it? You see I care for women&mdash;being one&mdash;a
good deal."</p>

<p>"Let us," said Marie Caton, "talk about fishing."</p>

<p>General Argyle chuckled. "Black doesn't think you
know anything about fishing. He has to acknowledge that
Mrs. Josslyn does&mdash;but then he thinks that she's a charming
<i>lusus naturæ</i>. I like to hear you give it to Black. Pay
him back. He's always giving it to me!"</p>

<p>"That's right!" said Black. "Pitch into me! Cover me
with obloquy! Poor homeless, friendless sailor with the pole
star mysteriously shifted from its place&mdash;" ...</p>

<p>"The homeless, friendless sailor stayed a long time, even
with the pole star shifted," remarked Marie, forty minutes
later.</p>

<p>"I certainly didn't mean to be rude," murmured Elizabeth,
her eyes upon the disappearing guests, now well on
their way to the bowling-alley. "They mean you never to
resent a thing which they would at once recognize for an impertinence
if one of themselves said it to another&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I shouldn't dub you rude," said the other. "And
if he found you uncomfortable for a minute, you made up for
it afterwards! You were charming enough, just as charming
as if the pole star had never shifted. He went off still in
mind the Eastern King."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Elizabeth, "that is where all of us are weak.
We say the truth, and then we bring in 'charm' and sandpaper
it away again! It's going to take another generation,
Marie!"</p>

<p>"Another?" said Marie. "A dozen, more like!&mdash;Now I
suppose I can read 'The Doll's House' in peace.&mdash;No, by
all that's fated in this place, here comes another guest!"</p>

<p>This was Ralph Coltsworth, but he made no long tarrying;
he was as transient as a butterfly. "Have you ladies seen
Hagar Ashendyne? I want her to go to walk with me, and I
can't find her anywhere."</p>

<p>"No, we haven't," said Marie. "Judge Black and General
Argyle are looking for you to play tenpins."</p>

<p>Ralph smiled back at her. "Let them look! It will do the
old codgers good. Do you like this place?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very much. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I like it so-so!" said Ralph. "It's a good enough
lotus land, but there's a lack somehow of wild, exciting adventure.
I've been trying to read on the hotel porch. What
do you think they're talking about over there? Fringed
doilies!"</p>

<p>"What do you like to do and to talk about?"</p>

<p>"Live things." He laughed, tossed an apple into the air
and caught it again. "I want first to make fifty millions, and
then I want to spend fifty millions!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"What an admirable American you are!"</p>

<p>"Am I not? And I vary it with just wanting to be a cowboy
with a six-shooter on a Western plain&mdash;" He tossed the
apple into the air again and, watching it, missed the glimpse
of Hagar which the other two received. She appeared around
the corner of a neighbouring cottage, her face directed toward
the traveller's-joy porch, saw Coltsworth, wheeled and withdrew.
He caught the apple, and after gazing meditatively
for a moment in the direction of the tenpin-alley, sighed, and
said that he supposed after all he might as well go help the
General demolish the Army of the Potomac. "That's what
he calls the pins when they're set up. He takes the biggest
bowl and sends it thundering. I believe he thinks for the
moment it is a ball from one of his old twenty-pounders. He
sees fire and smells smoke. Sometimes he demolishes the
Army of the Potomac and sometimes he doesn't; but he
never gets discouraged. The next cannon ball will surely do
the work!"</p>

<p>When he was gone, and had been gone twenty minutes or
more, Hagar reappeared. She came swiftly across the grass,
mounted the porch steps, and stood, with a little deprecating
shake of her head for the offered chair, by Elizabeth's
work-table. "I am not going to stay, thank you! Miss
Eden, somebody told me last night that you had written and
published books&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only text and reference books&mdash;compilations," said
Elizabeth. "I only do that kind of unoriginal work."</p>

<p>"Yes, but a book is a book," said Hagar. "What I wondered
was if you wouldn't be good enough to tell me some
things. No one in all my connection writes&mdash;I don't know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
any one to go to. I only want to know plain things&mdash;A, B,
C's of how to manage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About a manuscript, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I don't know anything. I've read all kinds of useless
things and so little useful! For instance," said Hagar,
"is it wrong to write on both sides of the paper?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

NEW YORK</h2>


<p>In August&mdash;the Ashendynes being back at Gilead Balm&mdash;the
"Young People's Home Magazine" published Hagar's
fairy story. Gilead Balm was impressed, but not greatly impressed.
It had the aristocratic tradition as to writers; no
Ashendyne had ever needed to be one. There had been editor
Ashendynes, in the old fiery, early, and mid-century times,
but editorship came out naturally from the political stream,
and the political, with law, planting, and soldiery, had been
the Ashendyne stream. The Ashendyne mind harked back
to Early Georgian, even to Stuart times; when you said
"writer" it saw something Grub Streetish. In addition,
Hagar's was, of course, only a child's story.</p>

<p>The two hundred dollars shrank in impressiveness from
being known of after and not before Medway Ashendyne's
letter. But to the eyes of her grandmother and her Aunt
Serena the two hundred dollars was the impressive, the only
really impressive, thing. Her grandmother advised that it
be put in bank. Miss Serena said that, when she was Hagar's
age, she had had a watch and chain for more than two
years. "What would you like to do with it, Gipsy?" asked
Captain Bob.</p>

<p>The colour came into Hagar's cheeks. "With one half I
want to get my two winter dresses and my coat and hat, and
with the other half I want to get books."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Books!" exclaimed the Ashendynes&mdash;the Colonel was
not present. "Why, aren't there books enough here?"</p>

<p>"They are not the kind of books I need."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Old Miss. "Get your winter clothes if
you wish,&mdash;though I am sure that Medway means now to
send the Colonel money for you,&mdash;but save the rest. It will
come in useful some day. Some day, child, you'll be thinking
about your marriage clothes."</p>

<p>"Luna and I came over the hill just now with Ralph Coltsworth,"
remarked Captain Bob cheerfully, apropos of nothing.
"He says he's studying hard&mdash;means to catch up at
the University and be a credit to the family."</p>

<p>Miss Serena was talented in taking offence at small things.
She had evolved the watch-and-chain idea and she thought
it should have received more consideration. In addition she
had the kind of memory that always holds the wrong things.
"Books! I suppose you mean a kind of books that we certainly
don't have many of here!&mdash;French novels and Darwin
and the kind of books those two Northern women were
reading this summer! Even when you were a child&mdash;don't
you remember, mother?&mdash;you had a perfect talent for getting
your hands on debasing literature! I supposed you had
outgrown it. I'm sure Mrs. LeGrand never encouraged it.
A hundred dollars worth of books!&mdash;and I suppose you are
to choose them! Well, if I were father, I'd look over the list
first."</p>

<p>"Aunt Serena," said Hagar, with a Spanish gravity and
courtesy, "there are times when I understand the most violent
crimes.... Yes; I know you don't know what I mean."</p>

<p>That was in August. September passed and part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
October, and then, late in that month, Hagar went to New
York.</p>

<p>Medway Ashendyne and his wife were travelling in the
East. Next year or the year after, they might, Medway
wrote, be in America. In the meantime, Hagar must have
advantages. He had not the least idea, he wrote his father,
what kind of a person she was. Her letters were formal, toneless
and colourless to a degree. He hoped she had not inherited&mdash;But
whatever she had inherited, she was, of course,
his daughter, and he must take care of her, being now in a
position properly to do so. His wife suggested, for the
moment, a winter in New York, properly chaperoned. The
money would be forthcoming (there followed a memorandum
of a handsome sum placed in bank to the Colonel's
credit). He could, he knew, leave it to his father and mother
to see that she <i>was</i> properly chaperoned. His wife had
thought of making certain suggestions, but upon talking it
over together, they had come to the conclusion that, at the
moment, at least, it would be wisest not to interfere with
the Gilead Balm order and way of life. It was admirably
suited, he judged, for a young girl's bringing up&mdash;much
better than the modern American way of doing things. Only
in France&mdash;or the Orient&mdash;was the <i>jeune fille</i> really preserved.</p>

<p>The Colonel wrote to Mrs. LeGrand. Mrs. LeGrand returned
one of her long, fluent letters. First of all, congratulations
that Hagar had come to her senses about Mr. Laydon,
then&mdash;"Now as to New York&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sylvie was going to New York too,&mdash;going to have singing
lessons, for she had a very sweet voice, and every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
agreed that it would be a mistake not to give it the best
training. The problem of how to manage for Sylvie had received
the following solution, and Mrs. LeGrand proffered
it as a possible way to manage for Hagar also. There was
Powhatan Maine's family in New York&mdash;Powhatan himself
and Bessie and their widowed daughter, Mrs. Bolt, with
her two children. They lived well, "in our quiet, homelike,
Southern fashion, of course." Powhatan was a solid lawyer
in a solid firm. Sylvie had paid them a visit once before, but
of course this year it was a question of her being in New
York for months and months. Now, ordinarily, the Maines
would not have heard of such a thing, but this disastrous
year, with everybody failing, Powhatan had lost heavily in
stocks and apparently they were having to economize. At
any rate, Bessie was willing, just for this year, to take Sylvie
under her wing and to let her pay for her room and board.
The Maines' house was a good, big one, and Mrs. LeGrand
had very little doubt that, just as a family favour, Bessie
would be willing to receive Hagar on similar terms. Bessie
would certainly stipulate that the arrangement should be a
quiet one, just between themselves, and that Hagar, no less
than Sylvie, should be regarded merely as a young friend and
connection, visiting her that winter. This understood, Bessie
would look after the two as if they were her own. It was fortunate
that neither Sylvie nor Hagar was "out," for the
Maines were in mourning. But Powhatan and Bessie knew
a great many people, and the two girls would probably
see company enough. "You remember Bessie, don't you?
Good-nature itself! Nothing pleases her so much as having
people happy about her." Then, too, there would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Rachel Bolt. She could take Hagar to the theatre and to concerts
and the picture galleries and where not. "The Maines
are all members of St. Timothy's&mdash;the Bishop's nephew's
church, you know."&mdash;In fine, Mrs. LeGrand advised that
the Ashendynes write at once to Mrs. Maine. It was done
and Hagar's winter soon arranged for.</p>

<p>New York!... She had dreamed of great cities, but she
had never seen one. The night on the sleeping-car&mdash;her
first night on any sleeping-car&mdash;she stayed awake and
watched through the window the flying clouds and the moon
and stars between, and, underneath, the fugitive landscape.
There was a sense of exaltation, of rushing on with the rushing
world. Now and again, as the train creaked and swung,
and once, as another roared past, there came moments of
fascinated terror. Rushing train and rushing world, all galloping
wildly through the night, and in front, surely some
bottomless precipice!... She and Sylvie had a section, and
though Hagar had offered to take the upper berth, it had
ended in their having it put back and sleeping together. Now
Hagar sat up in bed, and looked at the sleeping Sylvie.
There was a dim, blended light, coming from the lamp above
and the moonlight night without. Sylvie lay, half-uncovered,
fast asleep, her hair in glossy braids, her pretty face,
shell-tinted, sunk in the pillow, her breast quietly rising and
falling. Hagar had an intense, impersonal, abstract passion
for beauty wherever and in whatever form it resided. Now,
limbs beneath her, her arms nursing each other, she sat and
regarded the sleeping Sylvie with a pure, detached admiration.
The train roared into a station; she drew the window
curtain until it roared out again, then bared the window, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
sat and watched the flying dark woods and the silver surface
of some wide water. New York&mdash;New York&mdash;New
York....</p>

<p>Sylvie was a travelled lady. Sylvie had been to New York
before. She had been to Florida and New Orleans and Niagara
and Saratoga. She could play sweetly, not arrogantly,&mdash;Sylvie
was not arrogant, except, perhaps, a little when it
came to good looks,&mdash;the part of guide and mentor to Hagar.
In the Jersey City station she kept a reassuring touch upon
Hagar's arm down the long platform to the gate. "The New
York Ferry has a sign over it. Even if they don't meet us, I
know how to manage&mdash;Oh, there's Cousin Powhatan!"</p>

<p>It was a pearl-grey morning, going over, with a mist that
was almost a fog hanging upon the water and making unearthly
and like a mirage the strange sky-line before them.
There were not so many huge, tall buildings as there would
be in after years, but they were beginning. The mist drifted,
opening and closing, and to the mist was added the fairy garlands
and pennants of white steam. Out of the luminous
haze grew white ferryboats and low barges, and here passed
an opalescent shape like a vast moth wing. "A sailboat,"
said Hagar under her breath. The air was chill and clinging.
Sylvie and Captain Powhatan Maine preferred to sit and
talk within the cabin, but Hagar remained outside. She
stood with her hands lightly touching the rail, her eyes wide.
Another sailboat slipped past. She turned and looked along
the widening water, oceanward, and in a rift of the grey pearl
clouds she seemed to see, at a great distance, a looming woman
shape. A salt odour filled her nostrils. "Oh, the sea!
I smell the sea!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>The ferryboat glided into its slip, the bell rang, the chains
rattled; out resonantly, from the lower deck, passed the great
dray horses and heavy wagons; the passengers disembarked;
a crowd hurried, in column, toward the Elevated. Half-bewildered,
Hagar found herself mounting long flights of steps,
passing through a gateway, entering a train, which at once,
with a shriek, began to run upon a level with second-story
windows. She saw dingy red-brick factory and tenement
buildings close, close to her face; fire-escapes and staring
windows with squalid or horribly tawdry rooms beyond; on
the window-sills spindling, starved plants in ancient, battered
tin cans, children's faces, women leaning out, children,
children, children&mdash;"We have to go quite far uptown," said
Captain Maine. "Well, and what do you girls want to see
first?"</p>

<p>He was a short, stout, gallant gentleman with a fierce grey
mustache. Sylvie talked for both. Hagar nodded her head
or commanded a smile when manners seemed to indicate it,
but her mind was dealing with a nightmare. "Was this&mdash;was
this New York?" Once she turned her head toward their
escort, but something told her that if, indeed, she asked the
absurd question, he would say, "Why, yes! Don't you like
it?"</p>

<p>Where were the domes and colonnades? Where the cleanness
and fairness&mdash;where the order and beauty? Where was
the noble, great city? Where were the happy people? She
tried to tell herself, first, that all these were there, that this
was but a chance ugly street the train was going through ...
but they went through it for miles, and she caught glimpses
of so many other streets that seemed no better! And then she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
tried to tell herself, that, after all, she must have known it
would be something like this. She had seen before, on a
small scale, in a small city, decrepit buildings and decrepit
people of all ages. Poverty, dirt, and disease.... One city
would be like another, only larger.... She must have known.
But knowing did not seem to have helped&mdash;or perhaps she
had never really seen, nor thought it out. She was tired and
overstrained; a horror came upon her. She looked through a
window into a room hung with a ghastly green, torn, and soiled
paper. Men and women were working in it, bent over a long
table, working haggardly and fast, the shirts of the men,
the bodices of the women, open at the throat. Another window&mdash;a
wretched, blowsy woman and a young man with a
bloated, unwholesome face;&mdash;another, and an old, old woman
with a crying child, whom she struck;&mdash;then mere
blank windows or windows with starveling geraniums in
broken pots; and beneath and around and everywhere voices
and heavy wheels, and the train rushing on upon its trestle
high in the air. Something black and cold and hopeless rolled
over Hagar's soul. It was as though the train were droning,
droning, a melancholy text.</p>

<p>"Hagar! What is the matter? You looked as though you
were going to faint!"</p>

<p>But Hagar wasn't going to faint. She pulled herself together.
"No, no! It isn't anything! I was tired, I suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mustn't faint in New York," said Captain Maine
genially. "You'll get run over if you do."</p>

<p>On went the Elevated, and the walls of windows grew
vaguely better&mdash;or the shock of surprise was over&mdash;or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
armoured being within shouldered away a hampering unhappiness.
<i>New York&mdash;New York&mdash;New York!</i> Hope
and vision sprang afresh. The windows and the houses in
which they were set decidedly bettered. There were distant
glimpses of fine buildings, spires of churches, trees that must
be in a park. The sun, which had been all morning hidden by
clouds, came suddenly forth and flooded the world with October
gold. The gulf between what she had dreamed and
what she saw perceptibly narrowed, though it was still there
and though it still ached. "Here we are!" said Captain
Maine, and folded his newspaper. Out of the train upon a
platform&mdash;then more stairs, this time running downward&mdash;then
a block or two of walking, in the crisp air, then a very
different street from those the train had rushed through and
very different houses. "Here we are!" said their host again,
and they mounted a brownstone stoop. A coloured maid
opened the door&mdash;they passed into a narrow reception hall
with the Maines' ancestral tall clock standing by the stair
and on the opposing walls engravings of Southern generals;
thence, through folding doors, into a cool, deep parlour and
the embrace of Mrs. Maine.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maine was large and sleepy and quiet and dark, with
a nebulous personality. Everybody who knew her said that
she was extremely good-natured, while a few added that she
was too indolent to be irascible, and a fair number called it
native kindliness and adduced a range of respectable incidents.
No one ever hinted at intellectuality, and she certainly
did not shine in conversation; she was not, apparently,
socially ambitious, and nobody could be said to take less
trouble&mdash;and yet a number of people&mdash;chiefly Southerners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
dwelling in New York, the more decorative and
prosperous of St. Timothy's congregation, and Powhatan
Maine's legal associates and acquaintances&mdash;exhibited a
certain partiality for the Maine house. Powhatan told good
war stories and darky stories; almost always there appeared
something good to eat, with a Southern name and flavour;
and Mrs. Maine was as unobtrusive and comfortable to get
on with as the all-pervasive ether. There was nothing riotous
nor especially buoyant in the house; it was rather dim
and dull and staid; but people who had begun to visit the
Maines twenty years before visited still. Perhaps most of
them were dim and dull and staid themselves. Others, perhaps,
liked the occasional salt of an environment which was
not habitually theirs. The house itself was deep and for a
New York dwelling wide, cool, high-ceilinged, and dark, with
a gleam of white marble mantel-pieces and antiquated crystal
chandeliers, with some ancient Virginia furniture and some
ebony and walnut abominations of the 'seventies. Everything
was a little worn, tending toward shabbiness; but a
shabbiness not extreme, as yet only comfortable, though
with a glance toward a more helpless old age. There were a
fair number of books, some portraits and good, time-yellowed
engravings. There were four coloured servants beside
the nurse for Mrs. Bolt's children. The children, Charley and
Betty, were pudgy, quaint elves of three and five. Charley,
the younger, had been blind from birth.</p>

<p>That evening, Rachel Bolt came before bedtime into Hagar's
room. "May I sit and talk a little while? Sylvie and
mother and father and Dick Dabney, who came in a little
while ago, are playing duplicate whist."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course you may. It's such a pleasant room you've
given me."</p>

<p>Rachel turned in her chair and regarded it from wall to wall
somewhat cynically. "Well, I suppose at the first blush it
may seem so. It is, however, rather shabby. We meant to
do it over again this year, but times are so tremendously
hard that we gave it up with a lot of other things.&mdash;What I
really came in for was to ask what kind of things and places
and people you'd like to see this winter. It's agreed with
your grandfather that I'm to take you around."</p>

<p>"It is good of you to be willing to do it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm to be paid for doing it! I'll be spinning my
spring outfit and Betty's and Charley's while we gallivant.
But I do not mean"&mdash;she laughed&mdash;"that it is going to be
hard or disagreeable work, unless"&mdash;she ended coolly&mdash;"you
want to go to places where I don't want to go."</p>

<p>"To those places," said Hagar seriously, "I will go
alone."</p>

<p>"Then," said Rachel, "we will get along very well....
What do you want to do anyhow?"</p>

<p>"I want to feel around for a while. And I'd like to be
shown how to go and how to manage, just at first. But after
that I hope you won't mind if I just wander about by myself."
She lifted her long arms above her head in a gesture, harassed
and restless. "I think there are people to whom solitude
means as much as food or sleep."</p>

<p>"Do you want me to get up and say good-night?" asked
Rachel promptly.</p>

<p>Hagar gave a warm little laugh. "Not yet awhile. I'm
not that greedy and sleepy. I strive to be temperate....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
What I want to see first are pictures. I have never seen any&mdash;barring
those at home and at Eglantine."</p>

<p>"Well, we can go to the Metropolitan to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I should like that. Then I want to hear music. I have
never heard any to count."</p>

<p>"There'll be concerts and the opera later. The opera is, of
course, very expensive, but I understand that your father
wants you to do pretty well what you wish. If you don't
mind being high up, we can do a good deal of it reasonably."</p>

<p>"Then let us go high up."</p>

<p>"At the moment there aren't even concerts. We might
find an organ recital, and on Sundays there is music in the
park."</p>

<p>"Day after to-morrow is Sunday. I'll go and hear that.
Then I want to go to the theatre."</p>

<p>"Most of that will come later, too. Are you fond of the
theatre?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. That is why I want to go&mdash;to find out.
I have never seen but three plays."</p>

<p>"What an awfully lucky person! What were they?"</p>

<p>"One&mdash;I was a little girl and I went to Richmond for two
days&mdash;was 'Maria Stuart.' Janauschek played it. The
next was in the small town near where I live. It was rather
terribly done, I believe, and it kept me awake for a week
afterward. I was fifteen. It was 'The Corsican Brothers.'
Then"&mdash;said Hagar, "last winter I saw 'Romeo and Juliet.'... They
didn't seem like plays. They seemed like life,&mdash;sometimes
terrible and sometimes beautiful. I want to go to
find out if it is always so."</p>

<p>"It isn't," said Rachel. "You are inexperienced."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is a natural history museum here, isn't there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a large one."</p>

<p>"I want to go there. I want to see malachite and chrysoprase
and jade, and the large blue butterflies and the apes up
to man and the models of the pterodactyl and dinosaur and
a hundred other things."</p>

<p>"Until now," said Rachel, "I have thought that Charley
and Betty had the largest possible appetites. What else?"</p>

<p>"Am I tiring you?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. Besides, it is business. I came in here to get
a <i>catalogue raisonné</i>.&mdash;It's rather curious that you should
have such a passion for minerals and species and prehistoric
things."</p>

<p>"Is it? Well, I have it," said Hagar. She put her arms
again behind and above her head. "If you want to know All,
you must live All&mdash;though in honour preferring one to the
other."</p>

<p>Beside her, on the little table by the hearth, was a paper
and pencil. Suddenly she unlocked her hands, bent over and
drew a sheet of paper from under the book with which she
had covered it on Rachel's entrance. "I was trying to write
something when you came in. It is rough and crude,&mdash;just
the skeleton,&mdash;but it's something like what I mean and
what I want." She held it out; then, with a deprecating
gesture and a shy flush, "If it doesn't bore you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rachel took it and read.</p>

<p>"Dangerous?"</p>

<p>"You might take any disease&mdash;or get into any kind of

<p>"Why should they set traps?"</p>

<p>"Oh, all kinds of horrors happen.&mdash;Just look at the newspapers!
A girl&mdash;alone&mdash;you'd be subjected to insult."</p>

<p>Hagar sighed. "I've always been alone. And I don't see
that we are not subjected to insult everywhere. I could never
feel more insulted than, sometimes, I have been at home."</p>

<p>Rachel, turning in her chair, darted at her a lightning-like
glance of comprehension. "Well, that's true enough, though
I never heard it put into words before! It's true.... But it
remains that with our present conventions, you must have
company when you go to see how the other half lives."</p>

<p>"The other half?"</p>

<p>"It's a term: One half of us doesn't know how the other
half lives."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see," said Hagar. "Well, I'll be glad when I get out of
fractions."</p>

<p>Both laughed. A kind of soft, friendly brightness prevailed
in the third-floor back bedroom. There was no open fire,
but they sat on either side of the little squat table, and the
reading-lamp with a yellowy globe did the job of a common
luminary. The light reached out to each and linked them
together. Rachel Bolt was small and dark and slender. Much
of the time she passed for a cynical and rather melancholy
young woman; then, occasionally, sheaths parted like opening
wings and something showed that was vivid and deep and
duskily luminous. The next moment the rift might close, but
there had been received an impression of the inward depths.
She had been married at eighteen, her first child born a year
later. She was now twenty-five, and had been a widow for
two years. In worldly wisdom and <i>savoir faire</i>, and in several
emotional experiences she was well ahead of Hagar, but in
other respects the brain ways of the younger in years were
deeper and older. Whatever differences, their planes were
near enough for a comprehension that, continually deepening,
passed before long into the country of lasting friendship.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

LOOKING FOR THOMASINE</h2>


<p>When Hagar had been ten days in New York, she went early
one afternoon to find Thomasine. She had the address, and
upon showing it to Rachel the latter had pronounced it "poor
but respectable," adding, "Are you sure you ought to go
alone?"</p>

<p>"'Ought to go alone?&mdash;ought to go alone?'&mdash;I am so
tired of that phrase 'ought to go alone'!" said Hagar. "At
Gilead Balm they said, 'Don't go beyond the Mile-and-a-Half
Cedar!' You say yourself that I couldn't get lost, and I
was brought up with Thomasine, and Jim and his wife are
perfectly good people."</p>

<p>Downstairs, as she was passing the parlour doors, Mrs.
Maine called to her from within. "Where are you going,
dear?" Hagar entered and explained. "That is very nice of
you to look her up, but do you think you ought to go alone?"
Hagar explained that, too; whereupon Mrs. Maine patted
her hand and told her to trot along, but always to be careful!
As the front door closed after her, her hostess resumed her
box of chocolates and the baby sacque she was knitting. "It
isn't as though I had promised to give her, or to make Rachel
give her, continual chaperonage! To look after her in a
general way is all that could possibly be expected. Besides,
it's foolish always to be nervous about people!" She took a
chocolate cream and began the sleeve. "Medway Ashendyne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
with all those millions, isn't doing very much for her. She
couldn't dress more plainly if she tried. I wonder what he
means to do with her eventually. Perhaps he doesn't mean
anything&mdash;just to let things drift...."</p>

<p>Hagar knew how to orientate herself very well. She took
the surface car going in the right direction, and when she had
travelled some distance she left it and took a cross-town car.
This brought her to the block she wished. Out of the jingling
car, across a street of push-carts and drays and hurrying,
dodging people, she stood upon the broken and littered pavement
a moment to look about her. The houses were tall and
dreary; once good, a house to a family, but now not so good,
and several families to a house. The corners were occupied
by larger buildings, unadorned and jerry-built and ugly, each
with a high-sounding name, each containing "flats";&mdash;flats
and flats and flats, each with its ground floor occupied
by small stores&mdash;unprosperous greengrocer, unprosperous
butcher, poor chemist, prosperous saloon, and what not. It
was a grimy, chilly grey afternoon with more than a hint of
the approaching winter. All voices seemed raw and all colours
cold. Among the children playing on the pavement and
in areaways or on high, broken, entrance steps, there sounded
more crying than laughing. Dirty papers were blown up and
down; there floated an odour of stale beer; an old-clothes man
went by, ringing a bell and crying harshly, "Old clothes! Old
clothes! Got any rags?" Hagar stood with contracted brows.
She shivered a little. "Why, Thomasine should not live in
a place like this!" She looked about her. "Who should?"
She had a vision of Thomasine playing ring-around-a-rosy,
Thomasine looking for four-leaved clovers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>But when she climbed to the third floor of one of the corner
buildings, and, standing in the perpetual twilight of the landing-way,
rang the bell of a door from which much of the paint
had been scarred, she found that Thomasine did not live
there.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a gaunt, raw-boned woman.
"Thomasine Dale? Did she live with Marietta Green and
Jim?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She is Jim's niece."</p>

<p>"Well, she don't live here now."</p>

<p>"May I see Jim or his wife?"</p>

<p>"They don't live here neither."</p>

<p>The door across the landing opened, and a stout woman
in a checked apron looked out. "Was you looking for the
Greens?"</p>

<p>"Yes, please."</p>

<p>"If you'll come in and set a minute, I'll tell you about
them. I've got asthmy, and there's an awful draught comes
up those steps."</p>

<p>Hagar sat down in an orange plush rocking-chair and the
stout woman, having removed her apron, took the green and
purple sofa.</p>

<p>"There now! I meant to mend that carpet!"&mdash;and she
covered the hole with the sole of her shoe. "I am as fond as
I can be of the Greens! Jim's a good man, and if Marietta
wa'n't so delicate she'd manage better. The children are
nice youngsters, too.... Well, I'm sorry they've gone, but
Jim hurt his arm down in the Works and Marietta couldn't
seem to get strong again after the last baby, and everybody's
cutting wages when they ain't turning men off short, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Jim's turn come, for all he's always been good and sober and
a good workman. First the Works hurt his arm, and then it
said that he wasn't so useful now; and then it said that it had
seen for a long time that it would have to economize, and the
men could choose between cut wages or no wages at all,
and Jim was one of them it said it to. So he had to take the
cut." She began to cough and wheeze and then to pant for
breath. "Did you&mdash;ever have&mdash;the asthmy? I'm&mdash;going
off&mdash;with it&mdash;some day. Glass of water? Yes&mdash;next
room&mdash;cup by the sink.... Thank you&mdash;child! You're
real helpful.&mdash;What was I saying? Oh, yes&mdash;'t was Jim
and Marietta and the children and Thomasine who had
to economize."</p>

<p>"Where are they gone?" asked Hagar sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"It isn't so awful far from here. I'll give you the
address. The car at the corner'll take you there pretty
quick. But it ain't nowhere near so nice a neighbourhood
or a house as this." She regarded her plush furniture and
Nottingham curtains with pride. "Thomasine's an awful
nice girl."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hagar. The tears came into her eyes. "I love
Thomasine. I oughtn't to have waited so long before coming
to find her, but I never thought of all this. It never
entered my head."</p>

<p>"She's got an awful good place, for a woman&mdash;nine dollars
a week. She could have kept a room here, but she's awful
fond of Jim and Marietta and the children, and she went with
them. I reckon she'll help right sharp this winter&mdash;'less'n
the stores take to cutting too."</p>

<p>On the street-car, the new address in her hand, Hagar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
considered Poverty. It was there in person to illustrate, in an
opposite row of anæmic, anxious faces and forms none too
warmly clad; it was there on the street, going up and down;
it was there in the houses that were so gaunt, defaced, and
ugly. The very November air, cold and querulous, seemed
poor. Her mind was sorting and comparing impressions. She
had known, when she came to think of it, a good deal of poverty,
and a number of poor people. In the first place, she had
been brought up on the tradition of the poverty after the war&mdash;but
that had been heroic, exalted poverty, in which all
shared, and where they kept the amenities. Then, when that
had passed, there were the steadygoing poor people in the
country&mdash;those who had always been poor and apparently
always would be so. But it did not seem to hurt so in the
country, and certainly it was not so ugly. Often it was not
ugly at all. Of course, everybody at home, in a cheerful tone
of voice, called the Greens poor people. The Greens were poor,&mdash;Car'line
and Isham were poor;&mdash;she remembered, with a
curious vividness, the poor woman on the canal boat, the
summer her mother died. She had even heard the Colonel
say that he&mdash;the Colonel&mdash;was poor. Of course, she had
seen hosts of poor people. And yet until to-day, or rather,
to be more precise, until the morning of the ferry and the
Elevated, she had never generalized Poverty, never conceived
it abstractly. Poverty! What was Poverty? Why was Poverty?
Was it a constant; was it going to last? If so, why?
If it wasn't going to last, what was going to make things
better? It was desirable that things should be better&mdash;oh,
desirable, desirable! The slave of Beauty and the slave of
Righteousness in Hagar's soul rose together and looked upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the dump-heap and the shards that were thrown upon it. "It
shouldn't be. There is no need and no sense&mdash;"</p>

<p>Four or five summers past, visiting with Miss Serena some
Coltsworth or Ashendyne house in the country, and exploring,
as she always did almost at once, the bookcases, she
had come upon&mdash;tucked away in the extreme shadow of a
shadowy shelf&mdash;a copy of William Morris's "News From
Nowhere." Hagar had long since come to the conviction
that her taste was radically different from that of most Coltsworths
and Ashendynes. Where they tucked away, she drew
forth. She had read "News From Nowhere" upon that visit.
But she had read it hurriedly, amid distractions, and she was
much younger then than now. It had left with her chiefly an
impression of a certain kind of haunting, other-world beauty.
She remembered the boy and the girl in the tobacco-shop,
playing merchant, and the cherry trees in the streets, and the
cottage of Ellen, and Ellen herself, and the Harvest Home.
Why it was written or what it was trying to show, she had not
felt then with any clearness. Now, somehow, the book came
back to her. "That was what 'News from Nowhere' was
trying to show. That people might work, work well and
enough, and yet there be for all beauty and comfort and
leisure and friendliness.... I'll see if I can find that book
and I'll read it again."</p>

<p>The car stopped at the street-corner indicated. When she
was out upon the pavement, and again stood a moment to
look about her, she was frightened. This was the region of
the fire-escapes, zig-zagging down the faces of the buildings,
the ramshackle buildings. It was the region of the black
windows, and the women leaning out, and the wan children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
This street was narrower than the other, grimier and more
untidy, more crowded, colder, and the voice of it never died.
It rose to a clamour, it sank to a murmur, but it never vanished.
Usually it kept a strident midway, idle and fretful as
the interminable blown litter of the street. Hagar drew a
pained breath. "Thomasine's got no business living here&mdash;nor
Jim and Marietta and the children either!"</p>

<p>But it seemed, when she mounted a dirty, narrow stair and
made enquiries of a person she met atop,&mdash;it seemed that
they didn't live there. "They moved out a week ago. The
man was in some damned Works or other, and it threw him
on the scrap-heap with about a thousand more. Then the
place where the girl worked thought scrap-heaps were so
pretty that it started one, too. Then he heard a report of
work to be had over in New Jersey&mdash;as if, if this is the frying-pan,
that ain't the fire!&mdash;and so they left this state. No;
they didn't leave any address. Working people's address
this year is 'Tramping It. Care of the Unemployed.' Sometimes,
it's just plain 'Gone Under.'"</p>

<p>The man looked at Hagar, and Hagar looked at the man.
She thought that he had the angriest, gloomiest eyes she
had ever seen, and yet they were not wicked eyes. They
blazed out of the dark entryway at her, but for all their coal-like
glowing they were what she denominated far-away-seeing
eyes. They seemed to look through her at something
big and black beyond. "Have you seen the evening paper?"
he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"No, I have not. Why?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to see.... This morning's had an account of
three Anarchist bits-of-business. A bomb in Barcelona, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
bomb in Milan, and a bomb in Paris.&mdash;No, I can't tell you
anything more about your friends. Yes, I'm sorry. It's a
hard world. But there's a better time coming."</p>

<p>Grieving and bewildered, she came out upon the pavement.
Why hadn't Thomasine&mdash;why hadn't Jim let them know?
If there wasn't anything at home for Jim to do,&mdash;and she
agreed that there wasn't&mdash;nor for Thomasine, still they
could all have stayed there and waited for a while until Jim's
arm and hard times got better. She tried to put them all&mdash;there
were six&mdash;in the overseer's house with Mrs. Green. It
would be crowded, but.... The overseer's house was her
grandfather's; Mrs. Green had had it, rent free, since William
Green's death, and most of her cornmeal and flour came
from the Colonel's hand. Hagar tried to say to herself that
her grandfather would be glad to see Jim and Marietta and
Thomasine and the three children there staying with Mrs.
Green as long as was necessary; that if it were crowded in the
overseer's house her grandmother would be glad to have
Thomasine and perhaps one of the children stay in the big
house. It would not work. It came to her too, that perhaps
Jim and Marietta and Thomasine might not be so fond of
coming and sitting down on Mrs. Green and saying, "We've
failed." But couldn't they work in the country? Jim was a
mechanic; he didn't know anything about farming&mdash;and
the farmers were having a hard time, too. Hagar's head began
to ache. Then the travelling expenses&mdash;she tried to
count those up. If they couldn't pay the rent, how could
they pay for six to go down to Virginia&mdash;and the children's
clothes, and the food and everything?... Was there no one
who could send them money? Mrs. Green couldn't, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
knew&mdash;and Thomasine's mother and father were very poor,
and Corker wasn't doing well, and Maggie was at home
nursing their mother whose spine was bad.... Gilead Balm
had a kindly feeling for the Greens, she knew that. William
Green had been a good overseer, and he had fought in the
regiment the Colonel led. Her grandfather&mdash;if he knew
how bad it was, if he could see these places where they had
been living, if he could have heard the woman in the check
apron and the man with the eyes&mdash;he might send Jim
twenty-five dollars, he might even send him fifty dollars,
though she doubted if he could do that much. She herself
had twenty dollars left of that August two hundred. She had
been saving it for Christmas presents for Gilead Balm, but
now she was going to send it to Thomasine&mdash;just as soon as
she knew where to send it. She walked on for a little way in
a hopeful glow, and then the bottom dropped out of that, too.
It wouldn't go far or do much. It was too small a cloth to
wrap a giant in. Jim and Thomasine's unemployment&mdash;Jim's
injured arm, hurt in the Works, Marietta weak and
worn, trying to care for a little baby.... Other Mariettas,
Jims, Thomasines, thousands and thousands of them....
They were willing and wanting to work. They were not lazy.
Jim hadn't injured his own arm. Apparently there had to
be babies.... Unemployment, and no one to help when
help was needed.... It needed a giant. "All of us together
could do it&mdash;all of us together."</p>

<p>She was cold, even under her warm jacket and with her
thick gloves. The street looked horribly cold, but she did not
notice many jackets, and no gloves. With all her beauty-loving
nature she hated the squalid; nothing so depressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
her. She had not seen it before so verily itself; in the country
it was apt to have a draping and setting of beauty; even
a pigpen might be environed by blossoming fruit trees. Here
squalor environed squalor, ugliness ugliness. On a step before
her sat a forlorn little girl of eight or nine, taking care of
a large baby wrapped in a shawl. Hagar stopped and spoke.</p>

<p>"Are you cold?" The child shook her head. "Are you
hungry?" She shook it still; then suddenly broke forth volubly
in a strange tongue. She was telling her something, but
what could not be made out. The door behind opened, and
Elizabeth Eden came forth. She spoke to the child kindly, in
her own language, with a caressing touch upon the shoulder.
The little girl nodded, gathered up the baby, and went into
the house.</p>

<p>"Miss Eden&mdash;"</p>

<p>Elizabeth turned. "What&mdash;Why, Miss Ashendyne! Did
you drop out of the sky? What on earth are you doing in
Omega Street?"</p>

<p>"I came down here to find some people whom I know. I
am visiting in New York. Oh, I <i>am</i> glad to see you!"</p>

<p>"We can't stand here. The Settlement is just two blocks
away. Can't you come with me and have a cup of tea? Where
are you staying?"</p>

<p>Hagar told her, adding, "I must be back before dark or
they won't let me come out again by myself."</p>

<p>"It isn't quite four. I'll put you on the Elevated in plenty
of time.&mdash;What people were you looking for?"</p>

<p>Hagar told her as they walked. Elizabeth listened, knew
nothing of them, but said gravely that it was a common lot
nowadays. "I have seen many hard winters, but this promises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
to be one of the worst." She advised writing guardedly
to Mrs. Green, until she found out how Thomasine and Jim
wrote themselves. "They may not be telling her how bad it
is, and if she cannot help, it is right that they shouldn't. I
believe, too, in being hopeful. If they're sturdy, intelligent
people, they'll weather the gale somehow, barring accidents.
It's the miserable accidents&mdash;the strained arm, your Marietta's
illness after the baby&mdash;things like that that tip the
scales against them. Well, cheer up, child! You may hear that
they've got work and are happy.&mdash;This is the Settlement."</p>

<p>Three old residences, stranded long years ago when "fashionable
society" moved away, first street by street and at
last mile by mile, formed the Settlement. Made one building
by archways cut through, grave and plain, with a dignity
of good woodwork and polished brass and fit furniture
sparely placed, the house had the poise and force of a galleon
caught and held intact in the arms of some sargasso sea. All
around it were wrecks of many natures, strangled, pinned
down, and disintegrating, but it had not disintegrated. One
use and custom had left it, but another had passed in with a
nobler plan.</p>

<p>Hagar Ashendyne went through the place, wondering, saw
the workrooms, the classrooms, the assembly-room, the dwelling-rooms,
austere, with a quiet goodness and fairness, of the
people who dwelled there and made the heart of the place.
"It is not like a convent," she said in a low voice; "at least,
I imagine it is not&mdash;and yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, the two ideas have a point of contact!" answered
Elizabeth cheerfully. "Only, here, the emphasis is laid on
action."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>She met several people whom she thought she would like
to meet again, and at the last minute came in Marie Caton.
It was Marie, who, at five o'clock, put her on the Elevated that
would take her home in twenty minutes. Marie had met the
Maines&mdash;"I'm Southern, too, you know,"&mdash;and she promised
to come to see Hagar, and she said that Hagar and
Rachel Bolt must come, some Sunday afternoon, to the Settlement.
"That is chiefly when we see our personal friends."</p>

<p>That night Hagar wrote to her grandmother and to Mrs.
Green. In four days time she heard from the latter. Yes,
Jim and all of them and Thomasine had moved to New Jersey.
Times were hard, Jim said, and work was slack, and
they thought they could better themselves. Sure enough he
had got a right good job. They were living where it wasn't
so crowded as it was in New York, almost in the country,
right by a big mill. There was a row of houses, just alike,
Thomasine said, and they were living in one of them. There
wasn't any yard, but you could walk into the country and
see the woods, and Thomasine said the sky was wonderful at
night, all red from a furnace. Thomasine hadn't got work
yet, but she thought that she would. There was a place where
they made silk into ribbons, and she thought there'd be a
place for her there. Marietta was better, and the children
were fine. Mrs. Green sent the address&mdash;and Gilead Balm
certainly missed Hagar.</p>

<p>Old Miss wrote an explanatory letter. Hagar knew or
ought to know that they had little or nothing but the place.
The Colonel had been in debt, but Medway had cleared that
off, as it was right that he should, now that he was able to do
it; right and kind. But as for ready money&mdash;country people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
never had any ready money, she knew that perfectly well.
Medway was now, Old Miss supposed, a rich man, but no one
knew exactly how rich, and at any rate it was his money,
and living abroad as he did was, of course, expensive. He
couldn't justly be expected to do much more than he was
doing. "As for your having money to give the Greens, you
haven't any, child! Medway has told your grandfather that
he wants you from now on to have every proper advantage,
but that he does not believe in the way young people to-day
squander money, nor does he want you to depart from what
you have been taught at Gilead Balm. He wants you to remain
modest in your wants, as every woman should be. The
money he has put in your grandfather's hands for you this
year is to pay for this winter in New York and for wherever
you go next summer. He never meant it to be diverted to
helping people without any claim upon him that are out of
employment. Your grandfather won't hear to any such thing
as you propose. He says your idea of coming home and using
the money you are costing in New York is preposterous.
The money isn't your money; it's your father's money, to
be used as he, and not as you, direct.... Of course, it's a
hard year, and of course, there are people suffering. There
always are. But Jim's a man and can get work, and Thomasine
oughtn't to have gone away from home anyhow. They
aren't starving, child."&mdash;So Old Miss, and more to the
same effect, and then, at the end, a postscript. "I had a
ten-dollar gold-piece that's been lying by me a long time,
and I've taken it to Mary Green and told her to send it to
Jim. She seemed surprised, and from what she says and
what his letter says, I don't think they are any worse off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
than most people. You're young, and your feelings run
away with you."</p>

<p>Hagar wrote a long, loving letter to Thomasine, and sent
her the twenty dollars. Thomasine returned her effusive,
pretty thanks, showed that she was glad, and glad enough to
have the help, but insisted that she should regard it as a loan.
She acknowledged that Jim and she, and therefore Marietta
and the babies, had been pretty hard up. But things were
better, she hopefully said. She had a place and Jim had a
place. His arm was about well, and on the whole, they liked
New Jersey, "though it isn't as interesting, of course, as
New York."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

THE MAINES</h2>


<p>It was the year of the assassination of Sadi Carnot in France,
of the trial of Emma Goldman in New York, of much "Hellish
Anarchist Activity." It was a year of growth in the
American Federation of Labour. It was a year of Socialist
growth. It was a year of strikes&mdash;mine strikes, railway
strikes, other strikes, Lehigh and Pullman and Cripple Creek.
It was the year of the Army of Coxey. It was the year of the
Unemployed and of Relief Agencies. It was the year when
the phrase "A living wage" received currency.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1894 the Spanish War had not been, the
Boer War had not been, the Russo-Japanese War had not
been. The war between Japan and China was on the eve of
being; people talked of Matabeleland, and Cecil Rhodes was
chief in South Africa. Hawaii was in process of being annexed.
In the winter of 1894 it was the Wilson Tariff Bill, and Bimetallism,
and Mr. Gladstone and Home Rule, and the Mafia
in Sicily, and the A.P.A., and the Bicycle, and Queen Liliuokalani,
and the Causes of Strikes and of Panics, and Electric
Traction, and the romances of Sienkiewicz and "Tess of
the D'Urbervilles" and "The Prisoner of Zenda" and "The
Heavenly Twins." Mr. Howells was writing "Letters of an
Altrurian Traveller"; George Meredith had published "Lord
Ormont and his Aminta." Stevenson, at Vailima, was considering
"Weir of Hermiston."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1894 occurred the first voting of women in New Zealand.
It saw the opening of a Woman's Congress in Berlin.
In New York a Woman Suffrage Amendment was strongly
advocated before a Constitutional Convention. There was
more talk than usual of the Unrest among Women, more
editorials than usual upon the phenomenon, more magazine
articles. But the bulk of the talk and the editorials and the
magazine articles had to do with the business failures and
the Unemployed and the Strikes.</p>

<p>The beating of the waves of the year was not loudly
heard in the Maines' long, high-ceilinged parlour. The law
droned on, bad years with good. Powhatan had speculated
and made his little losses. His philosophy this winter was
pessimistic, and the household "economized." But the table
was still good and plentiful, and the coloured servants, who
were fond of him and he of them, smiled and bobbed, and
he had not felt it necessary to change his brand of cigars, and
the same old people came in the evening. Mrs. Maine never
read the newspapers. She rarely read anything, though once
in a while she took up an old favourite of her youth, and
placidly dipped now into it and now into her box of chocolates.
Powhatan kept her supplied with the chocolates. Twice
a week, when he came in at five o'clock, he produced out of
his overcoat pocket a glazed, white, two-pound box:&mdash;"Chocolates,
Bessie! Catch!"</p>

<p>Rachel Bolt was more alert to the world surge, but to her,
too, it must come a little muted through the family atmosphere.
Her swiftest vibrations were upon other lines, curious
inner, personal revolts and rebellions, sometimes consumed
below the crust, sometimes breaking forth with a flare and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
rain of words as of lava. The family and the people who
habitually came to the house were used to Rachel's way of
talking; as long as she did nothing <i>outré</i>,&mdash;and she did not,&mdash;it
was no more to them than a painted volcano. As for
Sylvie&mdash;Sylvie was as sweet and likeable as sugar, but not
interested in anything outside of the porcelain world-dish
that held her. She liked her clothes this winter, and the
young men who came to the house, and she dutifully practised
her voice, and enjoyed the shops and the plays, and
wondered a good deal if she was or was not in love with Jack
Carter, who was an interne in one of the hospitals, and who
sent her every week six of the new roses called American
Beauties. She had other, more distant relatives in New York,
people of wealth who presently took her up. She was with
them and away from the Maines a good deal, and, on the
whole, Hagar saw not much of Sylvie this winter. She and
Rachel were more together.</p>

<p>Almost every evening, at the Maines', people came in&mdash;old
Southern friends, living in New York, or here on business
or other occasions, young men and women, fond of Rachel,
acceptable fellow-sheep from the fold of St. Timothy, now
and then the rector himself, now and then some young man,
Southern, with a letter of introduction. Sometimes there
were but one or two besides the family, sometimes seven or
eight. There was little or no formal entertainment, but this
kind of thing always. Each day at dusk Hagar put on one of
the two half-festive gowns which, at the last moment, Miss
Serena had insisted she must have. Both were simplicity
itself, both of some soft, crêpy stuff, one dark bronze and one
dark green. They were made with the large puffed sleeves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of the period, and the throat slightly low and square.
"Country-made, but somehow just right," Rachel judged.
"You aren't any more adorned than the leaf of a tree, and
yet you might walk, just as you are, into Cæsar's palace."</p>

<p>Usually by half-past ten visitors were gone, lights downstairs
were out. Powhatan and Bessie believed in early to bed
and late to rise. Upstairs, in her bedroom on the third floor,
Hagar shook out and hung in the closet the bronze or green
dress, as the case might be, put on her gown and her red
wrapper, braided her hair, pushed the couch well beneath
the light, curled herself up on it under the eider-down quilt,
and, tablet against knee, began to write.... The Short
Story&mdash;it was that she dreamed and wrote and polished.
Two currents of thought and aspiration ran side by side.
"To earn money&mdash;to make my own living&mdash;to be able to
help"; and "To make this Idea, that I think is beautiful,
come forth and grow.&mdash;To get this thing right&mdash;to make
this dream show clear&mdash;to do it, to do it!&mdash;To create!"
The latter current was the most powerful. The former would
sooner or later accomplish its end; it would turn the mill-wheel
and be content. But the latter&mdash;never, never would
it be satisfied; never would it say, "It is accomplished."
Always there would be the further dream, always the necessity
to make that, too, come clear. There were other
currents, more or less strong, Desire of Fame, Desire to
be Known, Desire to Excel, and others; but the first two
were the great currents.</p>

<p>Since March and the fairy story she had written other
stories, four or five in all. She had sent them to magazines,
and all but one had come back. That one she had sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
immediately after her search for Thomasine. In a month she
had word that it was taken, and that, on publication, she
would be paid fifty dollars. The letter was like manna, she
went about all day with a rapt face. To write&mdash;to write&mdash;to
write stories like Hawthorne, like Poe....</p>

<p>She had been six weeks in New York. That night, when
she had worked for an hour over one half-page, and then, the
light out, had sat for a long while in the window looking at
the winter stars above the city roofs, she could not sleep
when she went to bed, but lay, straight and still, half-thinking,
half-dreaming. A pageant of impressions, waves of repeated,
altered, rearranged contacts drove through her mind.
The pictures and marbles of the Metropolitan, the sculptures
and casts of sculptures which she cared for more than for
the paintings, those of the latter which she loved&mdash;the music
that she had heard, the plays she had seen, the Park and the
slow, interminable afternoon parade of carriages watched
from a bench beneath the trees, Fifth Avenue, Broadway, the
hurrying crowds, the rush and roar, tramp and clangour, the
colour and bravura&mdash;Omega Street, the Settlement, a Sunday
afternoon there, discussions to which she had listened,
a mass meeting of strikers which, Powhatan having taken
her downtown to show her the Stock Exchange and Trinity,
they had inadvertently fringed, and from which, with epithets
of disapproval, he had hurried her away;&mdash;uptown
once more and the florists' windows and the wheels on the
asphalt, a Sunday morning at St. Timothy's with the stained
glass and the Bishop's nephew intoning;&mdash;again the theatres,
a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, the "Merchant of Venice,"
a play of Pinero's; again the pictures and the statues, the cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
of the great Venus, the cast of Niobe, of the Diana with the
hound, of Apollo and Hermes; the pictures, Rembrandts
and Vandykes, and certain landscapes, and a form that she
liked, firelit and vague, blind Nydia moving through ruining
Pompeii, and Bastien LePage's Joan of Arc; then the Park
again, and the great trees above the mall, and people, people,
people!&mdash;all made a vibrating whirl, vast, many-hued, and
with strange harmonies. She lay until it passed and sank like
the multi-coloured sand of the desert.</p>

<p>When at last she slept, she had a curious dream. She and
her mother were alone on an island with palm trees. She was
used to being with her mother in dreams. She had for the
memory of her mother so passionate a loyalty; the figure of
Maria, young, it always seemed to her, as herself, so kept
abreast with her inner life that it was but a naturalness that
she should be there in the dream mind, too. She was there
now, on the island with the palm trees, and the two sat and
looked at the sea, which was very blue. Then, right out of
the lonely sea, there grew a crowded wharf, with a white
steamship and people going to it and coming from it. Her
father came from it, dressed in white with a white hat like a
helmet, and then suddenly there was no wharf nor ship, but
they were in a curious street of low, pale-coloured houses&mdash;her
father and her mother and herself and the palm trees.
"Now we are all going to be happy together," she said; but
"No," said her mother, "wait until the procession passes."
Then there was a procession, and they were all women, and
at first they all had the face and eyes of Bastien LePage's
Joan of Arc, but then that faded, and they were simply many
women, but each of them carried a blossoming bough. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
saw faces that she knew among them, and she saw women
that she thought belonged to the Middle Ages, and Greek
women, and Egyptians, and savages. They went by for a
long time, and then, with a turn of the hand, the dream
changed, and they were all in a courtyard with a well and
more palm trees, and people coming and going, and they were
eating and drinking, and there was a third woman with them
whom her father called Anna. She had a string of jewels, and
she tried them, first on Hagar and then on Maria; but
Maria had a knife and suddenly she struck at her father
with it. She cut him across both wrists and the blood
flowed.&mdash;Hagar wakened and sat up in bed, shivering. Her
father's face was still plain against her eyeballs&mdash;bearded
and handsome, with red in his cheeks and the hat like a
helmet.</p>

<p>During Christmas week Ralph Coltsworth appeared. He
had to spend his holidays somewhere, he said. Hawk Nest
was dull and he didn't like Gilead Balm without Hagar.</p>

<p>"Ralph, why don't you study?"</p>

<p>"I do study. I'm a star student. Only I don't like the
law. I'm going to do a little more convincing myself and the
family, and then I'm going to chuck it! I've got a little
money to start things with. I want to go in with a broker I
know."</p>

<p>"What do you want to do that for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, because!... There are chances, if you've got the feeling
in your finger tips!... Don't you know, Gipsy, that something
like that is the career for a man like me? If I had been
my father, I could have waved my sword and gone charging
down history&mdash;and if I'd been my grandfather, I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
have poured out Whig eloquence from every stump in the
country and looked Olympian and been carried in procession
(I don't like politics now; it's an entirely different thing);&mdash;and
if I'd been my great-grandfather, I could have filibustered
or settled the Southwest; and back of that I could have
done almost any old thing&mdash;come over with the Adventurers,
seized a continent, shared England with the Normans,
marauded with the Vikings, whiled through Europe with
Attila, done almost anything and come out with a name and
my arms full! Now you can't conquer things like that, but,
by George, you can corner things!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?&mdash;That you want to become a rich
man?"</p>

<p>"That's what most of those others wanted. Yes, riches
and power."</p>

<p>"I was reading the other day a magazine article. It said
that the day when any American, if he had energy and ambition,
might hope to make a great fortune was past. It said
that the Capets and Plantagenets and Hapsburgs were all
here; that the dynasties were established and the <i>entente
cordiale</i> in operation; that young and adventurous Americans
might hope to become captains of mercenaries, or
they might go in for being court chaplains, and troubadours."</p>

<p>"Oh, that article had dyspepsia!" said Ralph. "It isn't
as easy as it was, that's certain! but it's possible yet, in 1894&mdash;if
you've got an opening."</p>

<p>"Have you got one?"</p>

<p>"Elder and Marten would take me in. Marten was an old
flame of my mother's, and I got his son Dick out of a scrape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
last year.&mdash;In ten years, you'll see, Gipsy! I'll send you
orchids and pearls!"</p>

<p>"I don't want them, thank you, Ralph."</p>

<p>Ralph took the flower from his buttonhole and began to
pluck away its petals. "Gipsy, I was awfully glad, last
summer, when you sent that Eglantine fellow about his
business."</p>

<p>"Mr. Laydon and I sent each other."</p>

<p>"Well, the road's clear&mdash;that's all I want to know!
Gipsy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ralph, it's no use. I'm not going to listen."</p>

<p>"The family has planned this ever since we were infants.
When you used to come to Hawk Nest with your big eyes
and your blue gingham dress and your white stockings&mdash;I
knew it somehow even then, even when I teased you
so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You certainly teased me. Do you remember the rain
barrel?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. The family has set its heart&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ralph, family can be such a tyrant! At any rate,
ours will have to take its heart off this."</p>

<p>Ralph turned sullen. "Well, the family used to settle it
for women."</p>

<p>"Yes, it did&mdash;when you came over with William the Conqueror!
Do you want to <i>take</i> me, regardless&mdash;just as you'd
take those millions? Well, you may take those millions, but
you can't take me!"</p>

<p>"Your father wants it, too. The Colonel showed me a
letter&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hagar stopped short&mdash;they were walking in the Park.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
"My father!... Do you think I owe my father so great a
love and obedience?" She looked before her, steadily, down
the vista of vast, leafless trees. "The strongest feeling,"
she said, "that I have about my father is one of strong
curiosity."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

THE SOCIALIST MEETING</h2>


<p>The house was full, said the man at the ticket-window. Nothing
to be had, short of almost the back row, under the gallery.
Rachel shook her head, and her cousin, Willy Maine,
leaving the window, expressed his indignation. "You ought to
have told me this afternoon that you wanted to go! Anybody
might have known"&mdash;Willy was from one of the sleepier
villages in one of the sleepiest counties of his native state&mdash;"Anybody
might have known that in New York you have to
get your tickets early! Now we've missed the show!" By
now they were out of the swinging doors and down upon
the pavement. The night was bright and not especially cold.
It was the Lyceum Theatre, and they stood at the intersection
of Fourth Avenue and Twenty-third Street.</p>

<p>"It's too late to try anything else," pondered Rachel.
"Willy, I'm sorry. But we truly didn't know we could go
until the last minute, and I didn't believe it would be
crowded."</p>

<p>"It's a beautiful night," said Hagar. "It's light and
bright, and there are crowds of people. Why can't we just
walk about until bedtime?"</p>

<p>Willy, who was nineteen but a young giant, pursed his
lips. "Is it proper for ladies?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I think so," said Rachel absently, "but would it really
amuse you, Hagar?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, it would. Let us go slowly, Rachel, and look in windows
and pretend to be purchasing."</p>

<p>Willy laughed, genially and patronizingly. "I've been
along here. There aren't any Paris fashions in these windows."</p>

<p>"I want," said Hagar succinctly, "to saunter through the
streets of a great city."</p>

<p>They began to walk, their faces turned downtown, staying
chiefly upon the avenue, but now and then diverging into
side streets where there were lights and people. By degrees
they came into congested, poorer quarters. To Willy, not
long removed from a loneliness of tidal creeks, vast stretches
of tobacco, slow, solitary sandy roads, all and any of New
York was exciting, all a show, a stimulus swallowed without
discrimination. That day Rachel had found occasion to rage
against a certain closed circle of conventions. The subject
had come up at the breakfast table, introduced by a headline
in the morning paper, and she had so shocked her family
that for once they had acted as though the volcano was real.
Mrs. Maine had grown moist and pink, and had said precipitately
that in her time a young woman&mdash;whether she were
married or single, that didn't matter!&mdash;would as soon have
thought of putting her hand in the fire as of mentioning such
things! And Powhatan had as nearly thundered as was in his
nature to do. Rachel shrugged her shoulders and desisted,
but she had gone about all day with defiance written in her
small, sombre face. Now to-night, the street, the broad
stripes of blackness, the thin stripes of gold light, the sound of
voices and of many footfalls, the faces when the light fell
upon them and the brushing by of half-seen forms suited her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
raised, angry, and mutinous mood. As for Hagar, the street
and its movement simply became herself. She never lost
the child's and the poet's power of coalescence.</p>

<p>It was before the days of Waring. The only White Wings
upon this avenue had been the snowflakes which a week ago
had fallen thickly, which had been dully scraped over the
curbing into the gutter, and which now stayed there in irregular,
one to three feet in altitude, begrimed Alpine ranges.
The cobblestones of the street between, over which the
great dray horses ceaselessly passed, were foul enough, while
the sidewalks had their own litter of torn scraps of paper,
cheap cigar ends, infinitesimal bits of refuse. The day of the
weirdness of electric lighting, of the bizarre come-and-go of
motion signs was not yet either. Down here there were occasional
arc lights, but gas yet reigned in chief. The shops, that
were not shops for millionaires, nor even for the Quite Comfortable,
all had their winking gaslights. Below them like
chequered walls sprang out the variegated show-windows.
The wares displayed were usually small in size, slight of value,
and high in colour, a kaleidoscopic barbaric display. Above
dark doorways the frequent three golden balls showed up
well.</p>

<p>Because the night was so mild and windless many people
were abroad&mdash;people not well-dressed, and yet not quite
poverty-stricken in aspect; others who were so, lounging
men with hopeless faces, women wandering by, pinched and
lost-looking; then again groups or individuals of a fairly prosperous
appearance. The flaring gas showed now and again
faces that were evidently alien, or there came a snatch of
strange jargon. A crowd had gathered at a street corner. A girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
wearing a dark-blue poke bonnet with a red ribbon across
it was going from one to the other holding out a tambourine.
A few pennies clinked into it. A man standing in the centre
of the crowd, raised his arm. "Now, we are going to sing."
The women in the bonnets beat upon the tambourines, a
man with a drum and another with a cornet gave the opening
bars, the women raised shrill, sweet voices,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"There is a fountain filled with blood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drawn from Immanuel's veins,</span><br />
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lose all their guilty stains&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<p>The hymn ended, a woman lifted both hands and prayed
with fervour and a strange, natural eloquence. Then the
squad gathered up horn and drum and tambourines, and,
drawing a part of the crowd with it, moved up the street to
another skirmish ground.</p>

<p>Rachel and Willy and Hagar drifted on. The night was
still young, the stars glittering above, the gaslamps making a
vista, the footfalls on the pavement murmurous as a stream.
The clanging of the street-car bell, the rush of a train on the
neighbouring Elevated, the abrupt rise and fall of passing
voices&mdash;all exercised a fascination. The night was coloured,
rhythmic. They came to a building, narrow and plain, with
lit windows, as of a hall, on the second floor, and with a clean,
fairly lighted stair going up from an open street door. Men
and women were entering. A care-worn, stooping, workman-looking
man stood by the door with handbills or leaflets
which he was giving out. "Socialist Meeting," he said.
"Good speaking. The Unemployed and the Strikes. Socialist
Meeting. Everybody welcome."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Hagar stopped. "Rachel, I want to go in here. Yes, I do!
Come now, be good to me, Rachel! Mr. Maine wants to go,
too."</p>

<p>"Socialists!" said Willy. "Those are the people who are
blowing up everybody with bombs. I didn't suppose New
York would let them hold a meeting! They're devils!"</p>

<p>But Willy had so well-grown a human curiosity that he was
not averse to a glimpse of devils. Perhaps he heard himself,
back home in the sleepy county, talking at the village post-office
or in the churchyard before church. "Yes, and where
else do you think I went? I went to a Socialist Meeting!
Bomb-throwers&mdash;Socialists and Anarchists, you know!"
Rachel, hardly more informed, was ready to-night for anything
a little desperate. She would not have taken Hagar
where she positively thought she ought not to go,&mdash;but if
these were desperate people going in, they were, to say the
least, pretty quiet and orderly and decent-looking;&mdash;and it
could do no harm just to slip in and sit on a back seat for a
few minutes and look on&mdash;just as you might go to mass
in a cathedral abroad, disapproving all the time, of course.
But Hagar had a book or two in her mind, and in addition
the talk that Sunday afternoon at the Settlement.</p>

<p>When they had climbed the stairs and come into the hall,
which was a small one, they found that the back seats were
all taken. Apparently all seats were taken, but as they stood
hesitating, a young man beckoned, and before they knew it
they found themselves well down the place, seated near the
platform. Rachel looked around a little uneasily. "Crowded,
and they all look so intent! It's not going to be easy to get
up and leave."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The hall was rude enough, and small, the light not brilliant,
the platform a few bare boards. Upon it stood a deal
table, and three or four chairs. Back of these, fastened
against the wall, was a red flag, and on either side of this a
strip of canvas with large letters. On one side, UNIVERSAL
BROTHERHOOD, and on the other, WORKINGMEN,
UNITE! Now standing beside the table, and slowly walking
from end to end of the platform, a dark-eyed, well-knit man
was speaking, quite conversationally, with a direct appeal,
now to this quarter of the hall, now to that. His voice was
deep and mellow; he spoke without denunciations, with a
quiet reasonableness and conviction. At the moment he
was stating a theory, giving the data upon which it was
based, weighing it, comparing it with its counter theory.
He used phrases&mdash;"Economic Determinism"&mdash;"Unearned
Increment"&mdash;"Class-Consciousness"&mdash;"Problem
of Distribution"&mdash;explained clearly what he meant by
them, then put them aside. "They are phrases that will
serve their ends and pass from speech," he said. "We shall
bring in modifiers, we shall make other phrases, and they, too, in
their turn, will pass from the tongues of men; but the idea
behind them&mdash;the idea&mdash;the idea and its expression, the
intellectual and moral sanction, the thing that is metaphysical
and immortal, that will not pass! The very word Socialism
may pass, but Socialism itself will be in the blood and
bone and marrow of the world that is to be! And this is
what is that Socialism." He began to speak in aphorisms,
in words from old Wisdom-Religions, and then, for all they
were stories of quite modern happenings, in parables&mdash;the
woe of the world epitomized, a generalization of its needs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
all lines of help synthesized into a world saviour, which, lo!
was the world itself. He made an end, stood a moment with
kindling eyes, then sat down. After an appreciable silence
there came a strange, deep applause, men and women
striking fist on palm, striking the bare floor with ill-shod
feet.</p>

<p>A small, wiry dark man, sitting on the platform, rose and
spoke rapidly for twenty minutes. He had a caustic wit and
the power of invective which, if possessed by the other, had
not been displayed. Once or twice he evoked a roar of
angry laughter. When he had finished, and the applause had
subsided, the chairman of the evening stood up and spoke.
"As the comrades know, it is our habit to turn the last half-hour
into an open meeting. Nearly always there's somebody
who's been thinking and studying and wants to say a word
as to what he's found&mdash;or there's somebody who's got a bit
of personal experience that he thinks might help a comrade
who's struggling, maybe, through a like pit. Anybody that
feels like speaking out, let him do it&mdash;or let her do it. Men
and women, we're all comrades&mdash;and though Socialists are
said not to be religious, we're all religious enough to like a
good experience meeting&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, waiting for some one to rise. The first speaker
came for a moment to his side. "Mr. Chairman, may I say
one word to our comrades, and to any others who may be
here? It is this. If 'religious' means world-service and a
recognition and a striving toward the ultimate divine in my
neighbour as in myself, and in myself as in my neighbour&mdash;then
I think Socialism may be called religious."</p>

<p>As he moved back to his chair a man arose in the back of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the house and began to speak. After a moment the chairman
halted him with a gesture. "It is difficult for the comrades
on this side the hall to hear you. Won't you come to the platform?"
The man hesitated, then nodded his head; and with
a certain deliberateness moved down the aisle, and stepping
upon the only slightly raised platform stood facing the gathering.
A colour flared in his cheek, and his hands, held somewhat
stiffly at his sides, opened and shut. It was evident
that he was not an accustomed speaker, and that there was
diffidence or doubt of himself and his welcome to be overcome.
He began stammering, with nervous hesitation. If
anything he <i>could</i> say would help by one filing he would say
it, though he wasn't used&mdash;yet&mdash;to speaking. He owed a
debt and he believed in paying debts&mdash;though not the way
the world made you pay them.</p>

<p>It was hard to tell how young or old he was. At times he
looked boyish; then, when a certain haggard, brooding aspect
came upon him, he seemed a middle-aged man. His clothes
were poor, but whole and clean, his shirt a grey flannel one.
Above the loose collar showed a short, dark beard, well-cut
features, and deep-set dark eyes.</p>

<p>Lines came into Hagar's forehead between her eyes. She
had seen this man somewhere. Where? She had a trick of
holding her mind passive, when the wanted memory would
slowly rise, like water from a deep, deep well. Now, after a
minute or two, it came. She had seen him in the street-car
that night, going from Eglantine to see "Romeo and Juliet."
He had been in workman's clothes, he had touched her skirt,
standing before her in the car; then he had found a seat, and
she had watched him unfold and read a newspaper. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
vague, uncertain thought that she could not trace had made
her regard him at intervals until with Miss Bedford and Lily
and Laydon she had left the car....</p>

<p>The man on the platform had shaken off the initial clumsiness
of speech and bearing. Like a swimmer, he had needled
the wave. He was not clumsy now; he was speaking with
short, stripped words, nakedly, with earnestness at white
heat. Once he had been dumb and angry, he said, as a maddened
dog. He had been through years that had made him
so. He had been growing like a wolf. There were times when
he wanted to take hold of the world's throat and tear it out.
"Do you remember Ishmael in the Bible?&mdash;his hand against
every man and every man's hand against him? Well, I was
growing to feel that way." Then at that point&mdash;"and that
was perhaps three years ago, and I was down South in a town
in my state, trying to get work. I knew how to break rock,
and I knew how to make parts of shoes, and I didn't know
much besides, except that it was a hard world and I hated it"&mdash;at
this point chance "or something" had sent him an
acquaintance, an educated man, a bookkeeper in the concern
where he finally got a job. Out of the acquaintanceship had
grown a friendship. "After a while I got to going to his
house. He had a wife who helped him lots." The three used
to talk together, and the man lent him books and made him
read them, and "little by little, he led me on. He was like an
old man I knew in the mountains when I was a boy. He
showed me that we're all sick and sorry, but that we're
growing a principle of health. He showed me how slow we
creep up from worm to man, and how now we're fluttering
toward something farther on, and how hands of the past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
come upon us, and how we yet escape&mdash;and the wings
strengthen. He showed me how vindictiveness is no use, and
how much that is wrong with the world is owing to poor social
mechanism and can be changed. He showed me what
Brotherliness means, on the road to Unity. He put it in my
mind and heart to want to help. He told me I had a good
mind. I had always rather liked books, but I'd been where
I couldn't get any, even if they'd given you time for reading.
He made me study things out, and one day I began to think&mdash;think
for myself&mdash;think it out. I've never stopped.
Usually now, I'm at night-school nights. I'm learning, and
I'm going to keep on, until I make thinking Wisdom." He
studied the ceiling a moment, then spoke out with a ring in
his voice. "I was a mountain boy. When I wasn't out of my
teens I got drunk at a dance and played hell-fool and almost
killed a man or two. Then the sheriff chased me up to Catamount
Gap, and the stuff was still in me and my head hitting
the stars, and I shot and shot at the sheriff.... Well, the
end of all that playing was that I went to the penitentiary
for four years. One thing I want wisdom for is to know how
to talk to people about what is called crime and about that
great crime, our law courts and penal system. Well, I came
out of the penitentiary, and then it was very hard to get work.
It was bitter hard. That's another thing I want learning and
wisdom for&mdash;to talk about that. You see, the penitentiary
wasn't content with the four years; it followed me always.
And then it's hard to get work anyhow. There wasn't any
use in going back to the mountains. But after a while I got
work and kept it. Then, three months ago, I came up here,
and I got work here. I'm working on your streets now, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
studying between times.... I'm standing up here to-night
to tell you that you've got a flag that draws the unhappy to
you, when it happens that they're seeking with the mind. I
don't know much about class-consciousness. We didn't have
it in the mountains, though, of course, we had it in the penitentiary.
But I know that we've got to take the best that
was in the past and leave the worst, and go on with the best
toward new things. We've got to help others and help ourselves.
And it doesn't do just to want to help; you've got
to have a working theory; you've got to use your mind. You've
got to consider your line of march and mark it out and
blast away the rock upon it and go on. And I am willing to
be of your construction gang. The man I was talking about
thought pretty much that way, too. He said there were a lot
of isolated people, here, there, and everywhere, not only
those that call themselves working-people, but others, too,
and women just as well as men, who were thinking that way&mdash;that
they might not call themselves Socialists, but that
they were blood kin just the same. I don't know why, to-night,
but I am thinking of something that happened when
I had been a year in the penitentiary, and they had rented a
lot of us up the river to make the bed for a railroad. While I
was up there, I couldn't stand it any longer, and I ran away.
They set the dogs on my track and took me, of course, but
before they did, I was lying in a thicket, and I hadn't had
anything to eat for two days and a night. A little girl,
about twelve years old, I reckon, came over a hill and down
to the stream by the thicket. She gathered flowers and set
them around a big rock for a flower doll tea-party. She had
two little apple pies and she put those in the middle&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
then she saw me, lying in the thicket. And I was wearing"&mdash;the
colour flared into his face, then ebbed&mdash;"I was wearing
stripes.... I don't think she ever thought of being frightened.
She gave me both pies, and she sat and talked to me like a
friendly human being. I've never forgotten. And when the
dogs came, as they did pretty soon, and the men behind them,
she lay on the grass and cried and cried as if her heart would
break. I've never forgotten. That's what I mean. I don't
care what we've done, if we're not fiends incarnate, and very
few of us are, we've got to feel toward one another like that.
We've got to feel, 'if you are struck, I am struck. If you
are wearing stripes, I am wearing stripes.' We've got to feel
something more than Brotherhood. We've got to feel identity.
And as a part, anyway, of that road seems to me to be
named Socialization, I'm willing to be called a Socialist."</p>

<p>He nodded to the audience, and, stepping from the platform,
amid a clapping of hands and stamping of feet, did not
return to his place in the back of the hall, but sat upon the
edge of the stage, his hands clasped around his knee. A German
clockmaker and a fiery, dark woman spoke each for
a few minutes, and then the meeting ended. There was a
noise of rising, of pushing back chairs, a surge of people, in
part toward the exit, in part toward the platform. Hagar
touched Rachel on the arm. "Wait here for me. I want to
speak to that man.&mdash;Yes, I know him. Wait here, Rachel."</p>

<p>She made her way to the space before the platform where
men and women were pressing about the speakers. The man
with the grey flannel shirt was answering a question or two,
put by the dark-eyed man who had spoken first. He stood
with a certain mountain litheness and lack of tension. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
movement, his answer given, brought him face to face with
Hagar. She had taken off her hat, so that it might not trouble
the people behind her, and she had it still in her hand.
Her dark, soft hair framed her face much as it had done in
childhood; she was looking at him with wide, startled eyes.</p>

<p>"I had to come to tell you," she said, "that I am glad
you came through. I never forgot you either."</p>

<p>"'Forgot you either!'&mdash;" The man stared at her.</p>

<p>"They were apple turnovers," she said; but before she had
really spoken there came the flush and light of recognition.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;h!..." He fell back a step; then, with a reddened
cheek and a light in his eyes, put out his hand. She laid hers
in it; his fingers closed over hers in a grasp strong enough to
give pain.</p>

<p>Then, as their hands dropped, as she fell back a little, the
second speaker came between, then others. Suddenly the
lights were lowered, people were staying too long. Rachel's
hand on Hagar's arm drew her back. "Come, we must go!"
Willy, too, was insistent. "It's getting late. Show's over!"
The space between her and the boy of the thicket, the figure
drawn against the sky of the canal lock, widened, filled with
forms in the partial dusk. She was half-drawn, half-pushed
by the outgoing stream through the door, out upon the stair,
and so down to the street, where now there were fewer lights.
The wind had arisen and the air turned colder. "We'll take
this cross-town car, and then the Elevated," and while she
was still bewildered, they were on the car. The bell clanged,
they went on; again, in what seemed the shortest time, they
were out in the night, then climbing the long stairs, then
through the gate and upon the rushing Elevated. Willy talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and talked. He was excited. "I thought it was going to be
all about bombs! But they talked sense, didn't they?&mdash;and
there was something in the air that kind of warmed you!
Next time I'm in New York I'm going again. Look at the
lights streaming off! By Jiminy! New York's great!"</p>

<p>He was not staying at the Maines', but with other
kinspeople a few blocks away. He saw the two in at the
door, said good-night, and went whistling away. Hagar and
Rachel turned off the lowered gas in the hall and went softly
upstairs.</p>

<p>As they passed Mrs. Maine's door she asked sleepily from
within, "Did you enjoy the play?"</p>

<p>"We didn't go," said Rachel. "We'll tell you about it in
the morning."</p>

<p>When the two had said good-night and parted and Hagar,
in her own room, kneeling at the window, looked up at the
Pleiades, at Aldebaran&mdash;only then came the realization
that she did not know that man's name, that she had never
heard it. In her thoughts he had always been "the boy."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

A TELEGRAM</h2>


<p>The next day she went down to the Settlement.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was at home. "Yes, I could give you a list of
books on Socialism. I read a good deal along those lines myself.
I am glad you are interested."</p>

<p>"I am interested," answered Hagar. "I cannot get any
of these books now, but I am looking for fifty dollars, and
when it comes, I will."</p>

<p>"But I can lend you two or three," said Elizabeth.
"Won't you take them&mdash;dear Hagar?"</p>

<p>She regarded the younger woman with her steady, friendly
eyes, her strong lips just parting in a smile. There was perhaps
nine years' difference in their ages, but mentally they
came nearer. It was the first time that she had dropped the
formal address.</p>

<p>Hagar answered with a warm colour and a tremulous light
from brow to chin. "Yes, if you'll be so good&mdash;Elizabeth!"</p>

<p>She crossed the floor with the other to the long, low, bookcase.
Elizabeth drew out a couple of volumes. "These are
good to begin with&mdash;and this." She stood a moment in
thought, her back to the case, her elbow resting on its polished
top and her head upon her hand. On a shelf behind her
stood a small bronze Psyche, a photograph of Botticelli's
Judith, a drawing of Florence Nightingale. "Hagar,"
said Elizabeth, "if I give you two or three books upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
position of woman in the past and to-day, will you read
them?"</p>

<p>"I will read anything you give me, Elizabeth."</p>

<p>She took her parcel of books and went back to the Maines'.
She read with great rapidity. Her memory was not a verbal
one, but her very tissues seemed to absorb the sense of what
she read. Much in these books simply formulated for her
with clearness what was already in solution in her mind. Here
and there she was conscious of lines of difference, of inward
criticism, but in the main they but enlarged a content already
there, but brought above the threshold, named and fed
what she was already thinking. Her mind went back to
Eglantine and Roger Michael's talk. "No. It did not begin
even here. It was in me. It had been in me a long time,
only I didn't know it, or called it other names."</p>

<p>Before these books were finished she got her fifty dollars
from the magazine, and the magazine itself was sent her with
her story in it. She sat and read the story, and it seemed
strange and new in its robe of print. The magazine had provided
an illustration&mdash;and how strange it was to see her
figures (or rather <i>not</i> her figures) moving and laughing there!
Again and again, after the first time, she opened the magazine
and in part or whole read the story and gazed upon the
illustration&mdash;half a dozen or more times during the first
twenty-four hours, then with dwindling frequency day after
day, for a week or so. After that her appetite for her own
completed work flagged. She laid the magazine away, and
it was years before she read that story again. The fifty dollars&mdash;She
put thirty-five away to go toward her summer
clothes and wrote to her grandmother that she had done so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
The remaining fifteen she expended on books, taking starred
titles from Elizabeth's list. In January she wrote "The Lame
Duck." She sent it to one of the great monthlies. It was
accepted, she was paid a fair price, and the monthly gave her
to understand that it should like to see <i>Hagar Ashendyne's</i>
next story.</p>

<p>The letter came as she was leaving the house for a walk in
the Park. There was no great distance to go before you came
to an entrance, and she often went alone and wandered here
and there by herself. The country was in her veins; not to
see trees and grass very often was very bad. She opened the
letter, saw what it was, then walked on in a rosy mist. After
a while, out under the branched grey trees, she found a bench,
sat down, and read it again and yet again. Her soul passioned
to do this thing; to write, to write well, to give out
wonderfully, beautifully. A letter that told her it was so, that
she was doing that which, with the strongest longing, she
longed to do, must be to her golden as a love letter. With it
open on her lap, with her eyes on the serene, pearl-grey
meadow on the edge of which she sat, she stayed a long time,
dreaming. A young man and woman, lovers evidently,
slowly passed her bench beneath the trees. She watched them
with tranquil eyes. "They're lovers," and she felt a reflex of
their bliss. They passed, and she watched as happily the
grey spaces where a few sheep stirred, and the edge of trees
beyond, dream trees in the mist.</p>

<p>Quite simply she fell to thinking of "the boy." He had
been often in her mind since the evening of that meeting; she
wondered about him a good deal. She did not know his name;
she had no idea where he lived; he might be in New York now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
or he might not be; she might pass him in the street and not
know&mdash;though, indeed, now she kept a lookout. He did
not know her name; she was to him "the little girl" as he
was to her "the boy." They might never meet again, but she
had a faith that it would not be so. What she felt toward him
was but friendliness, concern, and some admiration; but the
feeling had a soft glow and pulse. The most marked thing
was the consciousness that she knew him truly; reasoning did
not come into it; she could have told herself a dozen times
how little she did know, and it would have made no difference.
It was as though the boy and she had seen each
other's essential self through a clear pane of glass.</p>

<p>Her mind did not dwell long upon him to-day. She sat
with her hands crossed above the letter, and her eyes, half-veiled,
upon the far horizon. To write&mdash;to write&mdash;to produce,
to lead forth, to give birth, to push out and farther on
forever, to make a beautiful thing, and always a more beautiful
thing&mdash;always&mdash;always.... She was more mind than
body as she sat there; she saw her thought-children going up
to heaven before her.</p>

<p>There came an impulse to look on beauty that other minds
had sent forth. She rose and walked, with her light, rhythmic
swiftness, northward toward the Metropolitan. When she
passed the turnstile there lacked less than an hour of closing
time. She went at once toward the rooms where were the
casts. There was hardly a moving figure besides herself; there
were only the still, white giants. She entered an alcove where
there was a seat drawn before a cast of the tomb of Lorenzo
de' Medici. She sat down and gazed upon Michael Angelo's
Thinker. After a while her eyes moved to the great figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of Twilight and Dawn, and then, rising, she crossed to Guliano's
Tomb and stood before Day and Night. Presently she
left the alcove, and crossing by the models of the Parthenon
and of Notre Dame came into the Hall of the Antique and
into the presence of the great Venus. Here she stayed until
a man came through the place and said it was closing time.</p>

<p>In February she sent to the same monthly "The Mortal."
It passed from hand to hand until in due time it reached the
editor. He read it, then strolled into the assistant editor's
room:&mdash;"New star in the sky." But before Hagar could hear
from the monthly, another moment in her life was here.</p>

<p>A week after she had mailed this story, she and Rachel
were together one evening in the latter's room. It was pouring
rain, and there would be no company. Supper was just
over,&mdash;the Maines clung to supper,&mdash;and the children
had not been put to bed. Nightgowned, they made excursions
and alarms from their nursery into their mother's room
and out again and in again. Then Rachel turned out the
gas, and they all sat in the light of the coal fire, and first
Rachel told a story, and then Betty told one, and then Hagar,
and then Charley. They were all stories out of Mother
Goose, so no one had to wait long for their turn. Then Hagar
had to tell about Bouncing Bet and Creeping Charley, which
was a continued story with wonderful adventures, an adventure
a night. Then the clock struck eight with a leaden
sound, and Mammy appeared in the nursery door. "You
carry me!" cried Bouncing Bet, and "You carry me!" cried
Creeping Charley. So Rachel took one and Hagar took the
other, mounted them like papooses, and in the nursery shot
each into the appropriate small, white bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Back before the fire, with the lights still out, the two sat
for a time in silence. Hagar had a story in mind. She was
musing it out, seeing the figures come true in the lit hollows.
Rachel had a habit of crooning to herself. She went on now
with one of the children's rhymes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"Baa, baa, Black Sheep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have you any wool?"</span><br />
"Yes, sir, yes, sir, three bags full&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One for my master and one for my dame,</span><br />
And one for the little boy that lives in the lane!"<br />
</div>

<p>Hagar stirred, lifted her arms, and clasped her hands behind
her head. "How the rain pours! The winter is nearly
over. It has been a wonderful winter."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've found it so," said Rachel. "You've got
a wonder-world of your own, behind your eyes. Everything
spins out for good for you sooner or later and somehow or
other. You're lucky!"</p>

<p>"Aren't you lucky, too? Haven't you liked this winter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've liked it so-so! I've liked you."</p>

<p>"Rachel, I wish you'd be happy. You've got those darling
children."</p>

<p>"I am happy where the children touch. And, oh, yes, they
touch a long way round! But there's a gap in the circle where
you go out lonely and come in lonely."</p>

<p>"That's true of everybody's circle:&mdash;mine, yours, everybody's.
But you chafe so. You blow the coals with your
breath."</p>

<p>"I don't need to blow the coal. It burns without that....
Let me tell you, Hagar. There are two kinds of people in the
world. The people who are half or maybe two thirds the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
out of the pit and the mire and the slough and the shadow so
thick you can cut it! They are rising still, and their garments
are getting clean and white, and they can see the wonderful
round landscape, and they look at it with calm, wide eyes.
They're nearly out; they're more or less spectators. The
other kind&mdash;they're the poor, dull, infuriated actors.
They're still in; they can hardly see even the rim of the pit.
The first kind wants to help and does help. It's willing for
the others to lay hold of its hands, its skirts, to drag out by.
It's willing as an angel, and often the others wouldn't get out
at all if it didn't give aid. But it's seen, of course, and it's
away beyond.... People like Elizabeth Eden, for instance....
But the other kind&mdash;my kind.&mdash;It's all personal with
us yet&mdash;we're fighting and loving and hating, down here in
the muck and turmoil&mdash;all of us who are yet devils, and
those who are half-devils, and those of us who are just getting
vision and finding the stepping-stones&mdash;the animal and the
half-animal, and those who've only got pointed ears&mdash;all
resenting and striking out and trampling one another, knowing,
some of us, that there are better things and yet not knowing
how to get the shining garments; others not caring&mdash;Oh,
I tell you, life's a bubbling cauldron!"</p>

<p>"I know it is&mdash;deep above and deep below. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rachel rose, went to the window, and stood, brow against
the pane, looking out. The rain dashed against the glass; all
the street lights were blurred; the gusty wind shook the bare
boughs of the one tree upon the block, "You don't know
anything about my married life. Well, I'm going to tell you."</p>

<p>She came back to the fire, pushed a footstool upon the
hearth, and sat down, crouching close to the flame. "I'm not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
yet twenty-six. I was married to Julian Bolt when I was
eighteen. I'd known him&mdash;or I thought I'd known him&mdash;for
years. His mother and sisters went in summer to the
place in the mountains where we always went. They had
money, though less than people supposed. Julian spent two
weeks with them each summer. He was older than I, of
course,&mdash;years older. But he used to row us girls upon the
lake, and to play tennis with us, and we thought him wonderful.
We called him 'The Prince.' As I got older, he rowed
me sometimes alone on the lake, and now and then we went
for a walk together. He was good-looking, and he dressed
and talked well, and he spent money. I had heard somebody
call him 'a man-about-town'&mdash;but I didn't know what 'a
man-about-town' meant. There were two or three families
in the place with daughters out or about to come out, and
they made Julian Bolt very welcome. I never heard a father
or mother there say a word against him. Mine didn't.</p>

<p>"Well, I came out very early, and the summer after, when
I went to Virginia, to the White with my aunt, and that winter
when I stayed with some army people at Old Point, he
came to both places, and I knew that he came to see me.
He told me so.... Of course, though I would have died
rather than say it, even to myself, of course, I was expecting
men to fall in love with me and ask me to marry them&mdash;and
expecting to choose one, having first, of course, fallen in love
with him, and be married in white satin and old lace, and be
romantically happy and provided for ever after! Isn't that
the thinking rôle for every properly brought-up girl? The
funny thing is that I'd rather die than see Betty come upon
that treadmill they've built for a girl's mind!... Well, I was
on it all right....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"Julian had money, and he spent it recklessly. I didn't
see how recklessly; I didn't see anything except that he liked
me; for he sent me the most beautiful flowers, the most expensive
bon-bons and books and magazines. It was a gay
winter. Looking back, it seems to me that everybody was
eating and drinking, for to-morrow we die. I knew I must fall
in love&mdash;that had been suggested to me, suggested for years,
just as regularly and powerfully as any hypnotist could do it.
The whole world was bent on suggesting it to every young
girl. You see, the world's selfish. It wants to live, and it
can't live unless the young girl says Yea. And it can't leave
it, or it thinks it can't, to Nature working in a certain number
in her own good time. It must cheat and beguile and train
the girl&mdash;every girl&mdash;every girl! I tell you, I didn't know
any more about marriage than I did about life on the planet
Mars! I was packing my trunks for a voyage&mdash;and I didn't
know where I was going. I didn't know anything about it.
No one offered me a Baedeker.... It was orange blossoms
and a veil and a ring&mdash;and I didn't know what either meant&mdash;and
felicitations and presents and 'Hear the golden wedding-bells!'
and 'They lived happily ever after.' Julian was
handsome and lavish and popular, and his family were all
right, and if he had been gay he would now settle down; and
father and mother were satisfied, and people said I was to be
envied.... I married at eighteen. I hadn't read much. I
didn't know anything. No one told me anything. Maybe
the world thinks that if it tells, the young girl would say No.</p>

<p>"We went on a wedding-trip. I suppose sometimes a wedding-trip
isn't a mockery. I'm not so bitter as not to know
that often it isn't so&mdash;that often it is all right. I'm not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
denying love, and clean men and considerate. I'm not denying
hosts of marriages that without any very high ideal are
fit and decent enough. I'm not denying noble lovers&mdash;men
and women&mdash;and noble marriages. I'm only saying that
the other kind, the kind that's not fit nor clean nor decent
and anything but noble, is so frequent and commonplace
that it is rather laughable and altogether sardonic and devilish
to kneel down and worship as we do the Institution of Staying
Together&mdash;Staying Together at any price, even when evidently
the only clean thing to do would be to Stay Apart....
My wedding-trip lasted four months. I went eighteen, and I
came back old as I am now&mdash;older than I am now; for I have
grown younger these last two years. My marriage wasn't
the noble kind. It was the kind you couldn't make noble.
It wasn't even the decent, low-order type. It was a sink and
a pit and a horror."</p>

<p>She bent and stirred the fire. Outside the gusty wind
went by and the rain beat upon the windows. "I know that
there are marriages where woman is the ruiner. There are
women who are wreckers. They fasten themselves on a
man's life and drain it dry. They are devil-fish. They hold
him in their arms and break his bones. They're among the
worst of us struggling here in the pit. They're wicked women.
They may be fewer than wicked men, or they may be
equal in number, I don't know. I'm not talking of wicked
men or wicked women in that sense. I'm talking of men
whom the world does not call wicked, and of a great army of
women like myself, an army that stretches round the world
and through hundreds of years.... An army? It isn't an
army. We never had any weapons. We were never taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to fight. We were never allowed to ask questions. We were
told there were no questions to ask. We were young girls,
dreaming, dropped into the wolf pack ... and it goes on all
the time. It is going on now. It may be going on when Betty
grows up&mdash;though I'll tell her! You needn't be afraid. I'll
tell her....</p>

<p>"That wedding trip&mdash;that honeymoon. I had married
a handsome beast&mdash;a cruel one, too. He treated me like a
slave, bought for one purpose, wanted for one purpose, kept
for one purpose. I wasn't enough for him&mdash;I found that
out very soon. But those others were freer than I. They
made him pay them.... He would have said that he paid me,
too; that he supported me. Perhaps it's true. I only know
that I am going to have Betty taught to support herself."</p>

<p>"You should have left him."</p>

<p>"We were in Europe. I hadn't any money. I was beaten
down and stunned. When I tried to write to father and mother,
I couldn't. They would have said that I was hysterical,
and for God's sake to consider the family name!... I
have been a woman slow to develop mentally. What poise
I've got, what reading, what knowledge, what everything,
has come to me since that time. Then I didn't know how to
hold my head up and march out. Then I only wanted to
die.... We came home, and it was to find father with a desperate
illness. I couldn't tell mother then. I doubt if I
could ever have told her. I doubt if it would have done any
good if I had.... We went to live in a house up on the Sound.
Julian said his fortune was getting low, and that it would be
cheaper there. But he himself came into town and stayed
when he wished. He spent a great deal of money. I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
know what he did with it. He threw away all that he had.... I
knew by now that Betty was coming. She was born before
I was nineteen. And Charley was born a year afterward&mdash;born
blind, and I knew why. I loved my children. But my
marriage remained what it had always been. When Charley
was nearly a year old, I couldn't stand it any longer. If I
could stand it for myself, I saw that I couldn't stand it for
them. I couldn't let them grow up having that kind of a
mother, the kind that would stand it.... Julian went away.
Every two or three months he took all the money he could
lay his hands on and disappeared. I knew that he had dived
into all that goes on here, in some places, in this city. He
would be gone sometimes two weeks, sometimes longer.... Well,
this time I took Betty and Charley and came home,
came here&mdash;and they tried to persuade me to go back. The
Bishop was here, visiting his nephew, and he came and
tried to persuade me to go back. But I wouldn't ... and
there was no need. Within the week Julian was killed in a
fray in a house a mile, I suppose, from where we sit. That
was two years ago."</p>

<p>She rose and moved about the firelit room. "Yes, I've got
the two children, and life's healing over. I don't call myself
unhappy now. At times I'm quite gay&mdash;and you don't
know how eerie it feels! But happy or not, Hagar, I'll never
forget&mdash;I'll never forget&mdash;I'll never forget! They talk
about the end of the century, and about our seeing the beginning
of better things. They say the twentieth century will be
an age of clearer Thinking and greater Courage, and they talk
about the coming great Movements.&mdash;There's one Movement
that I want to see, and that's the Movement to tell the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
young girl. If I were the world I wouldn't have my dishonoured
life as it gets it now.... And now let's talk about something
else."</p>

<p>Hagar crossed to her, took her in her arms, and kissed her
lips and forehead. "I love you, Rachel. Come, let's look at
the rain, how it streams! Listen! Isn't that thunder?"</p>

<p>They stood at the window and looked out upon the slanting
lines and the glistening asphalt. The doorbell rang.</p>

<p>"Who on earth can that be?" Rachel went to the door,
opened it, and stood listening. "A telegram. Dicey is bringing
it up. It's for you, Hagar."</p>

<p>She struck a match and lit the gas. Hagar opened the
brown envelope and unfolded the sheet within. The telegram
was from Gilead Balm, from her grandfather:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cables from physician and Consul at Alexandria. Terrible
accident. Yacht on which were Medway and his wife wrecked.
His wife drowned, body not recovered. Medway seriously injured.
Life not despaired of, but believe it will leave him crippled.
Ill in hotel there. Unconscious at present. Every attention.
Your grandmother will fret herself ill unless I go. Insists
that you accompany me. Have telegraphed for passage on boat
sailing Saturday. Arrive in New York Friday morning. Get
ready.&mdash;Argall Ashendyne.</i></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

ALEXANDRIA</h2>


<p>"My master," said the valet, "is fond of Cairo and detests
Alexandria. As soon as he is able to be moved, if not sooner,
he will wish to be moved."</p>

<p>"He is not able now," said Hagar.</p>

<p>"No, Miss. He is still delirious."</p>

<p>"The doctor says that he is very ill."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss. But if I may make so bold, I think Mr. Ashendyne
will recover. I have lived with him a long time, Miss."</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Thomson, Miss."</p>

<p>The Colonel entered. "He didn't know me. Nor would
I have known him. He is pretty badly knocked to pieces.&mdash;What
have you got there? Tea? I want coffee." Thomson
moved to the bell, and gave the order to the Arab who appeared
with the swiftness of a genie. "Is there anything else,
sir?"</p>

<p>"No, not now."</p>

<p>"The English papers are upon the small table, sir." And
Thomson glided from the room.</p>

<p>The Colonel looked about him. "Humph! Millionaires
fix themselves luxuriously."</p>

<p>"I keep seeing her," said Hagar. "Her body lying drowned
there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>The Colonel glanced at her. "Pull yourself together,
Gipsy! Whatever you do, don't get morbid."</p>

<p>"I won't," Hagar answered. "I'm like you there, grandfather.
I hate it. But it isn't morbidness to think a little of
her."</p>

<p>The Arab brought the coffee. "Turkish coffee!" said the
Colonel, not without relish in his voice. "I always wanted to
taste&mdash;" He did so, appreciatively. "Ah, it's good&mdash;" He
leaned back in the deep wicker chair and gazed upon the
latest attendant. "And what may be your name?"</p>

<p>The figure spread its hands and said something unintelligible.
"Humph! Comment vous nommez-vous?"</p>

<p>"Mahomet, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"We've come, Gipsy," said the Colonel, "far from old Virginia.
Well, I always wanted to travel, but I never could. I
had a sense of responsibility."</p>

<p>It struck Hagar with the force of novelty that what he
said was true. He had such a sense. There had always been
times when she did not like her grandfather, and times when
she did. But during the last two weeks, filled with a certain
loneliness and strangeness for them both, she had felt nearer
to him than ever before. There had chanced to be on the
boat few people whom he found congenial. He had been
forced to fall back upon his granddaughter's companionship,
and in doing so he had made the discovery that the child had
a mind. He liked mind. Of old, when he was most sarcastically
harsh toward Maria, he had yet grudgingly admitted
that she had mind&mdash;only, which was the deep damnation,
she used it so wrongheadedly! But Gipsy&mdash;Gipsy wouldn't
have those notions! The Laydon matter had been just a foolish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
girl's affair. She had been obstinate, but she had seen her
mistake. As for Ralph&mdash;Ralph would get her yet. The
Colonel had been careful, in their intercourse during the voyage,
to bring forward none of her mother's notions. He found
that she knew really an amazing amount of geography and
history, that to a certain extent she followed public events,
that she knew Byron and could quote Milton, and that
though she had no Greek (he had forgotten most of his), she
was familiar with translations and could not only give a connected
account of the Olympian family, but could follow in
their windings the minor myths. The long voyage, the hours
when they reclined side by side in their steamer chairs, or
with the country need for exercise paced from prow to stern,
and from stern to prow, taught him more about his granddaughter
than had done the years at Gilead Balm. She told
him of the acceptance of "The Lame Duck" and the sending
of "The Mortal," and he was indulgent toward her prospects.
"There have been women who have done very good work of
a certain type. It's limited, but it's good of its kind. As
letter-writers they have always excelled. Of course, it isn't
necessary for you to write, and in the Old South, at least,
we've always rather deprecated that kind of thing for a
woman."</p>

<p>The Colonel drank his thick coffee from its little metal cup
with undeniable and undenied pleasure. He was not hypocritical,
and he never canted. His only son lay in a large bedroom
of this luxurious suite, maimed and hardly conscious,
and whether he would live or die no one knew. But the Colonel
had never wept over Medway in the past and he was not
going to weep now. He drank his coffee leisurely, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
it was done Mahomet took salver and cup away. Rising, the
Colonel walked to one of the windows and stood looking out
at a bougainvillæa-covered wall, a shaggy eucalyptus tree,
and a seated beggar, fearful to the eye. It was afternoon,
and they had been in Alexandria since eight o'clock. "I sent
a cable to your grandmother. The doctors think he's holding
his own, but I don't know. It looks pretty bad. They've got
a nurse from a hospital here,&mdash;two, in fact,&mdash;and that man
Thomson is invaluable.... I've seen, too, this morning, before
they let me into the room, his wife's brother. It seems
that he was in London at the time, and came on and has very
properly waited here for our arrival. We walked through the
Place Mahomet Ali, and he took me to a very good club,
where we sat and talked.... Her will&mdash;it's rather curious.
I suppose Medway, if he lives, will be disappointed. And yet,
with care, he'll have enough." The Colonel laughed, rather
grimly. "We'd think in Virginia, that a million was a good
livelihood, but standards are changing, and doubtless he's
been feeling many times that amount between his fingers. It
occurred to me that they must have quarrelled. It's like a
woman to fling off and do a thing like that hastily. Her
brother says, however, that he believes they were really
happy together. He fancies that she had some feminine
scruple or other as to the way her first husband obtained his
wealth,&mdash;as the world goes, entirely honourable transactions,
I believe,&mdash;and that she had an idea of 'restoring' it.
She made this last will in London, just before they started on
this long trip that's ended so. It's been read. There's a
string of bequests to servants and so on. She leaves just one
million, well invested, to Medway. The rest, and it's an enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
rest, goes into a fund, for erecting model lodging-houses
and workmen's dwellings. Philanthropy mad!" said the
Colonel. "Her brother's got, I understand, some millions of
his own, and he could afford to smile. Also, he's been supposing
for a year that it would all go to Medway. Well, that's
where Medway is&mdash;if he lives. Fifty thousand or so a year,"
said the Colonel, regarding the beggar, "is not an income to
be despised. I should be happy if I saw, each year, in clear
money, an eighth as much."</p>

<p>There came a knock at the door and the physician entered.
He was an American, a young, fresh-coloured man
with an air of strength and capability. He had lunched with
the two Ashendynes, and now came in as one at home. He
looked graver now than then; there was a plain cloud upon
his brow. "I don't believe he can hold out," he said abruptly.
"He has a magnificent constitution, and his body is making
a splendid fight, but&mdash;It may come at any minute with a
quick collapse. Of course, I'm not saying that it will be so.
But if Miss Ashendyne wishes to see him, or to be with him
if it should happen to be the end&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hagar turned deadly pale. The Colonel, not usually considerate
of her or given to thinking that she needed consideration,
was somehow different to-day. "If you'd rather not,
Gipsy&mdash;? Indeed, I think that you had better not. It isn't
as though you had been always with him." He turned to the
physician. "She has seen very little of her father since baby-hood."</p>

<p>But Hagar had steadied herself and risen from her chair.
"Thank you, grandfather, but I would rather go with you."
It was almost sunset, and the splendid western light flooded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the chamber where the sick man lay. He lay low upon the
pillows, with only a light covering. There had been, beside
injuries to spine and limb, and some internal hurt, a bad
blow over the head. This was bandaged; fold after fold of
gauze wrapped around forehead and crown. "Oh," thought
Hagar, "it is like the white helmet in that dream!" But
the features below were not flushed with health; they were
grey and drawn. The second physician, standing at the bed-head,
lifted his hand from the pulse and moved to the side of
the first. "A little stronger." The nurse placed a chair for
Hagar. Thomson, at the windows, raised the jalousies higher,
and the light evening breeze blew through the room. "It
may or it may not be," said the first doctor in a low voice
to the Colonel. "If he pulls through to-night, I'll say he
wins."</p>

<p>The amber, almost red, light of the sun bathed the bed.
When the sun sank, a violet light covered it. When the short
twilight was gone, and the large, mild stars shone out, they
brought shaded lamps, and the bed lay half in that light and
half in the shadow. In the room, through the slow passing
hours, hushed, infrequent movements took place, the doctors
relieving each other in the watch by the bed, the night
nurse arriving, the giving of stimulants, whispered consultations
by the window. The adjoining room was prepared for
rest and relaxation; there was a table with bread and cold
meat and wine. The Colonel came and went, noiseless as a
shadow, but a restless shadow. Once or twice during the
night his touch upon her shoulder or his hand beckoning from
the doorway drew Hagar forth. "You'd better rest, child.
Here, drink this wine!" Each time she stayed half an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
or so, either in the room or out upon the balcony which gave
upon a garden, but then she stole back into the bedroom.</p>

<p>She sat in a big chair which she had drawn aside and out of
the way. She could, however, see the bed and the figure upon
it; not clearly, because the lights were low, but dimly. She
rather felt than saw it; it was as though a sixth sense were
busy. She sat very still. Her father.... Through her mind,
automatically, without any conscious willing, drifted words
and images that spoke of father and child. It might be a
Bible verse, it might be a line from a younger poet, it might
be an image from some story or history. Father and child&mdash;father
and daughter&mdash;father and daughter.... To sit and
see her father die, and to feel no deep sorrow, no rending
sense of companionship departing, no abject, suffocating
pulsing of a stricken heart, no lifted hope and faith or terror
for him, no transcending sense of self-relinquishment, while
the loved one flew farther and swifter and higher out of her
sight, away from this life's low level.... She could not feel
any of that. As little as the Colonel did she believe in or
practise cant. She knew that she could not feel it thus, and
knew why. But there was a great forlornness in sitting there
and watching this stranger die.</p>

<p>She tried to strengthen the faint memories that the past
held. Was she five or six years old the last time she had seen
him? The distinctest image was of underneath the cedars at
Gilead Balm. There was a shawl spread upon the grass. Her
father was lying on it, his hat tilted over his eyes. There was
a book beside him. She had been gathering dandelions, and
she came and sat down on the edge of the shawl and opened
the book. She thought every book had pictures, but there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
were none in that one. Then he had waked up and laughed
at her, and said, "Come here!"&mdash;It flashed into her consciousness,
from where it had lain unrecalled all these years,
just what he had said. He had said, "Come here, Miss
Ugly, Ill-omened Name!" She had gone, and in playing with
her he had accidentally burned her finger with his lighted
cigar. And then&mdash;it came to her with an effect of warmth
and sunshine, and with a feeling of wanting to laugh, with
tears in her eyes&mdash;he had been beautifully, charmingly
shocked and apologetic. He had taken her away and made
Old Miss bandage the finger, and then he had shouldered her
and carried her into the orchard and broken boughs of apple
blossoms for her and told her "Jack and the Beanstalk." ...
That was almost all she could remember; or if there were one
or two less agreeable things, she would not remember those
now. She tried to keep the warmth about her heart; on the
whole, aided by human pity for the broken form upon the
bed, she succeeded better than she could have dreamed.</p>

<p>The man upon the bed!&mdash;Outside the fatherhood, outside
the physical relation between them&mdash;there he was, a
human being with death hovering above. It was easier
to think of him just as a fellow-being; she laid hold of that
thought and kept it. A fellow-mortal&mdash;a fellow-mortal.
With a strange sense of relief, she let the images and words
and the painful straining for some filial feeling pass from her
soul. She did not know why she should feel toward him
filially; he had not, like her mother, suffered to give her
life; he had probably never thought of her; she had not been
to him the concern in the matter. Nor hardly since had he
acted parentally toward her. With a wry humour she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
to concede the winter in New York, the summer at the New
Springs, but it hardly seemed that the sacrifice could have
been great, or that the need for gratitude was extreme. Her
soul rose against any hypocrisy. She could not and she would
not try to say, "Dear father&mdash;dear father!" The vision of
her mother rose beside her.... But just to think of him as a
human being&mdash;she could do that; a man lying there on the
knife edge of the present, with the vast, unplumbed gulf
before him.... That dream of the blue sea and the palm
trees and the low pale-coloured houses returned to mind, but
she put it from her somewhat shudderingly. He had looked
so abounding in life, so vivid and vital, with the white hat
like a helmet!... A fellow-mortal, lying there, helpless and
suffering....</p>

<p>At three in the morning the physician in charge, who had
been sitting for some time beside the bed, rose and moved
away. He nodded his head to his fellow. Hagar caught the
satisfaction in the gesture even before, in passing her chair,
he paused to say just audibly, "I think your father will recover."
A short time passed, and then the Colonel touched
her arm. "They think it safe for us to go. He is stronger.
Come! They'll call if there is any need, but they don't think
there will be."</p>

<p>Going, she stopped for a moment close beside the bed. She
had not been this near before. Medway lay there, with his
head swathed in bandages, with his lips and chin unshorn,
with no colour now in his cheeks, with his eyes closed. Hagar
felt the sudden smart of tears between her own lids. The gold
thread of the dandelion day tied itself to the natural human
pity and awe. Her lips trembled. "Father!" she said, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
lowest of whispers. Her hand moved falteringly until, for
the lightest moment, it rested upon his.</p>

<p>In the outer room the physician joined them. "He'll still
have to fight for it, and there may be setbacks. It's going to
be a weary, long, painful siege for him, but I don't believe
he's going to die. Indeed, I think that, except in the one respect,
we'll get him back to being a well man with a long life
before him."</p>

<p>"And that respect?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, Colonel Ashendyne, that he'll never walk
again. If he does, it will be with crutches and with great
difficulty."</p>

<p>When, half an hour later, Hagar opened the door of her
own room, the dawn was coming. It was a comfortable
bedroom, large, cool, and high-pitched, and it, too, had a
balcony. The bed invited; she was deadly tired; and yet she
doubted if she could sleep. She stood in the middle of the
room, her hands over her eyes, then, a little stumblingly, she
went out upon the balcony. It was a small place, commanding
the east. There was a chair and a little table on which
you could rest your arms, and your head upon them, sideways
so that you could see the sky. It was just grey light;
there were three palm trees rustling, rustling. After a while
purple came into the sky, and then pale, pale gold. The wind
fell, the palms stood still, the gold widened until all the east
was gold. She saw distant, strange, flat roofs, a distant dome
and slender towers, all against the pale, pale gold. The air
was cool and unearthly still. Her head upon her arm, her
face very quiet, her eyes open upon the deepening light, she
stayed until the gardeners came into the garden below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

MEDWAY</h2>


<p>Five days later, Medway, one morning, recognized the Colonel.
"Why, my dear father, what are you doing here?...
What's it all about?" His feeble voice died away; without
waiting for an answer, he lapsed into a kind of semi-consciousness.
Out of this, day by day, though, he came
more strongly. Directly he appeared to accept, without
further curiosity, his father's occasional presence in the room.
Another interval, and he began to question the physician and
nurses. "Back, eh?&mdash;and leg, and this thing on my head.
I don't remember.&mdash;A kind of crash.... What happened?"</p>

<p>Evasive answers did for a while, but it was evident that
they would not do for ever. In the end it was Thomson
who told him.</p>

<p>"You did, did you!" exclaimed the doctor in the outer
room. "Well, I don't know but what it's just as well!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it, sir. He pinned me down."</p>

<p>The Colonel spoke. "Just what and how much did you
tell him?"</p>

<p>"I told him, sir, about the wreck, and how he got beaten
about, and how I fastened him, when he was senseless and
we were sinking, to a bit of spar, and how we were picked up
with some of the crew about dawn. And about his being
brought here, and being very well cared for, and your coming
from New York, you and Miss Ashendyne, and that he'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
been wonderful close to dying, but was all right now, and
what the date was, and things like that, sir."</p>

<p>"Did he ask for his wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you told him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The doctor rose. "Well, I'm glad it's done. I'll go see&mdash;" and
disappeared into the sick-room.</p>

<p>"I think you did well, Thomson," said the Colonel. "When
you've got to take a thing, you'd better stand up and take
it, and the quicker the better."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Thomson; and adjusted the jalousies, it
being now very warm and the glare at times insupportable.</p>

<p>The Colonel, under the guidance of a dragoman of the best,
had been shopping, and was in white duck. Hagar, too, had
secured from a French shop muslin and nainsook.</p>

<p>Thomson had been concerned for her lack of any maid or
female companionship. He had gently broached the subject
a week or two before. "Mrs. Ashendyne had an excellent
maid, Miss, who was with us on the yacht that night and was
saved. But she's of a high-wrought nature, and the shock
and cold and everything rather laid her up. She has a brother
who is a photographer in Cairo, having married a native
woman, and she's gone to stay with him awhile, before she
goes back into service. If that hadn't been the case, Miss,
you might, if you wished, have taken her on. I think she
would have given satisfaction. As it is, Miss, I know some
English people with a shop here, and I think through them
I could find you some one. She would not be a superior
lady's maid like Cécile, but&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Hagar had declined the offer. "I never had a maid, thank
you, Thomson. I can do for myself very well."</p>

<p>She liked Thomson, and Thomson agreed with the nurse
that she was a considerate young lady. Now, having adjusted
the blinds, Thomson left the room.</p>

<p>The Colonel paced up and down, his hands behind him.
The white duck was becoming; he did not look sixty. Hair,
mustache, and imperial were quite grey; except for that
he had never aged to Hagar's eyes. His body had the
same height and swing, the same fine spareness; his voice
kept the same rich inflections, all the way from mellow and
golden to the most corroding acid; he dominated, just as she
remembered him in her childhood. Not all of his two weeks
in Egypt had been spent by Medway's bedside; he had been
fairly over Alexandria, and to Meks and Ramleh, and even
afield to Abûkir and Rosetta. He had offered to take her with
him upon these later excursions, but she had refused. The
brother of her father's wife was going with him, and she correctly
thought that they would be freer without her. The
Colonel acquiesced. "I dare say you'll have chances enough
to see things, Gipsy." It was her first intimation that any
one had in mind her staying....</p>

<p>Now the Colonel, after pacing awhile, spoke reflectively.
"At this rate it won't be long before he's really well enough
to talk. I'll have to have several talks with him. Did you
gather, Gipsy, that Thomson had told him that he would
remain crippled?"</p>

<p>"I do not think he told him that, grandfather."</p>

<p>"That's going to be the shock," said the Colonel. "Well,
he'll have to be told! I think Thomson&mdash;or the doctor&mdash;had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
better do it. And then he'll have to learn about that will.
Altogether, it may delay his convalescence a little. Of course,
I'll stay until he's practically recovered&mdash;as far as he can
recover."</p>

<p>"Do you think that ... perhaps ... he might like to go
home&mdash;to go home to Gilead Balm?"</p>

<p>"Not," answered the Colonel, "if I know Medway, and
I think I do! To come back, crippled, after all these primrose
years&mdash;to sleep in his old room, and Maria's&mdash;to sit
on the porch and listen to Bob and Serena&mdash;No!"</p>

<p>That night in her own room Hagar placed two candles on
the table, took a sheet of paper and a pencil, and sitting
down, made a calculation. The night was warm to oppression;
through the windows came the indefinite, hot, thick
murmur of the evening city. Hagar sat with bare arms and
throat and loosened hair. She wrote her name, <i>Hagar Ashendyne</i>,
and her age, and then, an inch below, a little table,&mdash;</p>

<p>After a pause the pencil moved on. "Many stories in mind,
one partly written. The monthly says I can write and will
make a name." It paused, then moved again. "To earn a
living. To live where life is simple and doesn't cost much.
If I go on, and I will go on, I could live at Gilead Balm on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
what I make, and help keep up the place. If ever I had to
live by myself, I could get two or three rooms in a city and
live there. Or maybe a small house, and have Thomasine
with me. In another year or two years, I can keep myself.
I do not want to stay here when grandfather goes. Where
there is no love and honour, what is the use? It isn't as
though he needed me&mdash;he doesn't&mdash;or wanted me&mdash;"</p>

<p>She laid the pencil down and leaned back in the deep chair.
Her eyes grew less troubled; a vague relief and calm came
into her face, and she smiled fleetingly. "If he doesn't think
he needs me or wants me,&mdash;and I don't believe he'll think
so,&mdash;then there isn't anything surer than that I won't stay."
She rose and paced the room. "I shouldn't worry, Hagar!"</p>

<p>Some days after this, she offered one afternoon to relieve
the nurse. She had done this before and frequently. Heretofore
the service had consisted, since the patient almost
always slept through the afternoon, in sitting quietly in the
darkened chamber and dreaming her own dreams for an hour
or two, when the grateful nurse came back refreshed. To-day
she was presently aware that he was awake; that he was
lying there with his eyes open, regarding the slow play of light
and shadow upon the ceiling. She had found out, on those
earlier occasions, that he did not discriminate between her
and the usual nurse; when he roused himself to demand water
he had looked no farther than the glass held by her hand to
his lips. Now, as she felt at once as with a faint electric
shock, it was going to be different. He spoke presently. His
voice, though halting and much weakened, resembled the
Colonel's golden, energetic drawl.</p>

<p>"What time is it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Five o'clock."</p>

<p>"What day of the month?"</p>

<p>She told him. "Alexandria in April!" he said. "What impossible
things happen!"</p>

<p>She did not answer, and he fell silent, lying there staring at
the ceiling. In a few minutes he asked for water. The glass
at his lips, she felt that he looked with curiosity first at the
hand which held it, and then at her face. "Water tastes
good," he said, "doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it does." She put down the glass and returned to
her seat.</p>

<p>"You aren't," he said, "the nurse I've had."</p>

<p>"No; she will be back presently."</p>

<p>There followed another pregnant silence; then: "A beautiful
string of impossibilities. I know the Colonel's here&mdash;been
here a long time. Now, did I dream it or did Thomson
tell me that he'd brought my daughter with him?"</p>

<p>"Thomson told you."</p>

<p>Medway lay quite quiet and relaxed. The cut over the
head was nearly healed; there was now but a slight fillet-like
white bandage about it. Thomson had trimmed mustache
and short pointed beard; the features above were bloodless
yet, but no longer sunken and ghastly; the eyes were gathering
keenness and intelligence. Ashendynes and Coltsworths
were alike good-looking people, and Medway had taken his
share. He knew it, prized it, and bestowed upon it a proper
care. Hagar wondered&mdash;wondered.</p>

<p>He spoke again. "Life's a variorum! I shouldn't wonder
... Hagar!"</p>

<p>"Yes, father?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suppose you come over here, nearer. I want to see how
you've 'done growed up.'"</p>

<p>She moved her chair until it rested full in a slant ray of
sunlight, coming through the lowered blinds, then sat within
the ray, as still almost as if she had been sculptured there.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed. "Haven't you any other name than
Hagar?" said Medway. "Are they always going to call you
that?"</p>

<p>"Grandfather calls me Gipsy&mdash;except when he doesn't
like what I do."</p>

<p>"Does that happen often? Are you wilful?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Hagar. "I am like my mother."</p>

<p>When she had spoken, she repented it with a pang of fear.
He was in no condition, of course, to have waked old, disturbing
thoughts.</p>

<p>But Medway had depth on depth of <i>sang-froid</i>. "You
look like her and you don't look like her," he murmured.
"You may be like her within, but you can't be all like her.
Blessings and cursings are all mixed in this life. You must be
a little bit like me&mdash;Gipsy!"</p>

<p>"It is time," said Hagar, "for an egg beaten up in wine."</p>

<p>She gave it to him, standing, grave-eyed, beside the bed.
"I do not think you should talk. Shut your eyes and go to
sleep."</p>

<p>"Can you read aloud?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can you sing?"</p>

<p>"Not to amount to anything. But I can sing to you very
low until you go to sleep, if that's what you mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right. Sing!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>She moved from the shaft of light, and began to croon
rather than to sing, softly and dreamily, bits of old songs and
ballads. In ten minutes he was asleep, and in ten more the
nurse returned.</p>

<p>The next afternoon Thomson brought her a message. "Mr.
Ashendyne would like you to sit with him awhile, Miss."</p>

<p>She went, and took her chair by the window, the nurse
leaving the room. Medway lay dozing, his eyes half-closed.
After a while he woke fully and asked who was there.</p>

<p>"It is Hagar, father."</p>

<p>"Sit where you were yesterday."</p>

<p>She obeyed, taking again her place in the slant light. It
made a gold crown for her dusky hair, slid to the hollow of
her firm young throat, brought forward her slender shoulders,
draped in white, and bathed her long hands, folded in her lap.</p>

<p>Medway lay and looked at her, coolly, as long as he pleased.
"You are not at all what is called beautiful. We'll dismiss
that from mind. But the people who give us our terms are
mostly idiots anyhow! Beauty in the eye of the beholder&mdash;but
what bats are the beholders! No, you haven't beauty,
as they say, but there's something left.... I like the way
you sit there, Gipsy."</p>

<p>"I am glad that you are pleased, father."</p>

<p>"I couldn't deduce you from your letters."</p>

<p>Her eyes met his. "I did not choose that you should."</p>

<p>Again she felt a quiver of pain for what she had said. She
was torn between a veritable anger which now and again
rose perilously near the surface and a profound pity for his
broken body, and for what he would feel when he knew. Her
dream of the early winter haunted her. She saw him leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
that white steamer, coming lightly and jauntily down from
it to the shore, robust, with a colour in his cheeks and his
white hat like a helmet. She heard again Roger Michael
speaking. "We met him at Carcassonne, and afterwards at
Aigues-Mortes. He was sketching most wonderfully." She
saw him, moving lightly, from stone to stone in old half-ruined
cities. The dandelion day and the blossoming orchard
came back to her; she felt again beneath her his half-dancing
motion as he carried her under the boughs where the
bees were humming. Her pity, her comprehension, put the
anger down.</p>

<p>Medway was watching her curiously. "You have a most
expressive face," he said. "I do not remember you well as a
child. How old were you the last time we met?"</p>

<p>"Five or six, I think. The clearest thing I can remember,
father, is one day when you were lying under the cedars and I
had been gathering dandelions and came to look at a book
you had. You played with me, and I accidentally burned my
finger on your cigar. Then you were very kind and lovely;
you took me to grandmother to have it tied up, and then you
carried me on your shoulder through the orchard, and told
me 'Jack and the Beanstalk.'"</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Medway. "Why, I remember that, too!... First
the smell of the cedar and then the apple blossoms.... You
were a queer little elf&mdash;and you entered into
the morals of 'Jack and the Beanstalk' most seriously....
Good lack! Whoever forgets anything! That to come back
as soft and vivid!... Well, I thought I had forgotten you
clean, Gipsy, but it seems I hadn't."</p>

<p>"You mustn't talk too much. Shall I sing you to sleep?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sing!"</p>

<p>Just before he dozed off, he spoke again, drowsily. "Have
you heard them say how many days it will be before I am on
my feet again?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I will want to show you and the Colonel&mdash;" But she
had begun to croon "Swanee River," and he went to sleep
with his sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>The next day he spoke of his drowned wife. It came as a
casual remark, but with propriety. "Anna was a good woman.
There could hardly have been a more amiable one. She had
experience and tact; she was utterly unexacting. She had her
interests and I had mine; we lived and let live.... I cannot
yet understand how she happened to have been the one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She sent me her picture," said Hagar. "I thought it very
handsome, and a good face, too. And the two or three letters
I had from her&mdash;I have kept them."</p>

<p>"She was a good woman," repeated Medway. "You
rarely see a tolerant woman&mdash;she was one. Her brother
has told me about her will. It is true that I expected, perhaps,
a fuller confidence. But it was her money&mdash;she
had a right to do as she pleased. I knew that she had some
unfortunate idea or other as to the origin of her wealth&mdash;but
I did not conceive that her mind made so much of
it.... However, I refuse to be troubled on that score.
Her disposition of matters leaves me comfortable enough.
I am not worrying over it. I never worry, Gipsy!"</p>

<p>After lying for three minutes he spoke with his inimitable
liquid drawl. "When I think of all the years out of which
I have squeezed enjoyment on the pettiest income&mdash;going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
here and going there&mdash;every nook of Europe, much of Asia
and Africa&mdash;just managing to keep Thomson and myself&mdash;knowing
every in and out, every rank and grade and caste,
palace and hovel, château and garret, camp and atelier,
knowing pictures, music, scenery, strange people and strange
adventures, knowing my own kind and welcome among
them&mdash;now basking like a lizard, now in action as though a
tarantula had bit me&mdash;everywhere, desert and sea and city&mdash;and
all on next to nothing!&mdash;making drawings when I
had to (I did that one year in southern France; Carcassonne,
Aigues-Mortes, Nîmes, and so forth), but usually fortunate
in friends ... it seems that I might be able to manage on fifty
thousand a year ... resume at the old house."</p>

<p>It was another week before he was told. He was growing
impatient and suspicious.... The doctor did it, Thomson
flunking for the first time in his existence. The doctor, having
done it, came out of the room, drew a long breath, and accepted
coffee from Mahomet with rather a shaking hand.</p>

<p>"Well?" demanded the Colonel. "Well?"</p>

<p>"He's perfectly game," said the doctor, "but I should say
he's hard hit. However,"&mdash;he drank the coffee,&mdash;"there's
one thing that a considerable experience with human nature
has taught me, and that is, Colonel, that your born hedonist&mdash;and
it's no disparagement to Mr. Ashendyne to call him
that; quite the reverse&mdash;your born hedonist will remain
hedonist still, though the heavens fall. He'll twist back to
the pleasant. He's going through pretty bitter waters at
the moment, but he'll get life somehow on the pleasurable
plane again. All the same," mused the doctor, "he's undoubtedly
suffering at present."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"I won't go in," said the Colonel. "Better fight such
things out alone!"</p>

<p>The other nodded. "Yes, I suppose so."</p>

<p>But a little later Hagar went in. She waited an hour or
two in her own room, sitting before a window, gazing with
unseeing eyes. The heat swam and dazzled above countless
flat, pale, parapetted roofs of countless houses. Palm and
pepper and acacia and eucalyptus drooped in the airless day;
there sounded a drone of voices; a great bird sailed slowly on
stretched wings far overhead in a sky like brass. She turned
and went to her father's room.</p>

<p>Outside she met Thomson. "Are you going in, Miss? I'm
glad of that. Mr. Ashendyne isn't one of these people whom
their own company suffices&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hagar raised sombre eyes. "I thought that my father had
always been sufficient to himself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not in trouble, Miss."</p>

<p>He knocked at the door for her. Medway's voice answered,
strangely jerky, quick, and harsh. "What is it?
Come in!"</p>

<p>Thomson opened the door. "It's Miss Hagar, sir," then
closed it upon her and glided away down the corridor.</p>

<p>Medway was lying well up upon his pillows, staring at the
light upon the wall. He had sent away the nurse. He did not
speak, and Hagar, moving quietly, went here and there in the
large room, that was as large as an audience chamber. At the
windows she drew the jalousies yet closer, making a rich twilight
in the room. There were flowers on a table, and she
brought fresh water and filled the bowl in which they lived.
There were books in a small case, and, kneeling before it, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
read over their titles, and taking one from the shelf went
softly through it, looking at the pictures.</p>

<p>At last, with it still in her hand, she came to her accustomed
seat near the bed. "It's a bad day for you," she said
simply. "I am very sorry."</p>

<p>"Do you object to my swearing?"</p>

<p>"Not especially, if it helps you."</p>

<p>"It won't&mdash;I'll put it off.... Oh&mdash;h...." He turned
his head and shoulders as best he could, until his face was
buried in the pillows. The bed shook with his heavy, gasping
sobs....</p>

<p>It did not last. Ashendynes were not apt long to indulge
in that kind of thing. Medway pulled a good oar out of it.
The room very soon became perfectly still again. When the
silence was broken, he asked her what she was reading, and
then if she had seen anything of the city. Presently he told
her to sing. He thought he might sleep; he hadn't slept
much last night. "I must have had a presentiment of this
damned thing&mdash;Go on and sing!" She crooned "Dixie"
and "Swanee River" and "Annie Laurie," but it was of no
use. He could not sleep. "Of all things to come to me,
this&mdash;!... Why, I should like to be out in the desert this
minute, with a caravan.... O God!"</p>

<p>She brought him cool water. "I'm sorry&mdash;I'm sorry!"
she said.</p>

<p>As she put down the glass, he held her by the sleeve. A
twisted smile, half-wretched, half with a glint of cheer,
crossed his face. "Do you know, Gipsy, I could grow right
fond of you."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

AT ROGER MICHAEL'S</h2>


<p>On an early April afternoon in the year 1902 a man and
woman were crossing, with much leisureliness, Trafalgar
Square.</p>

<p>"We won't get run over! It isn't like Paris."</p>

<p>"Aren't you tired, Molly? Don't you want a hansom?"</p>

<p>"Tired? No! What could make me tired a day like this?
I want to go stroke the lions."</p>

<p>They gravely went and did so. "Poor old British Lion!&mdash;Listen!"</p>

<p>News was being cried. "<i>Details of fight at Bushman's Kop!</i>"</p>

<p>Christopher Josslyn left the lions, ran across and got a
paper, then returned. "A small affair!" he said. "How interminably
the thing drags out!"</p>

<p>"But they'll have peace directly now."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but it's Poor old Lion, just the same&mdash;"</p>

<p>They moved from the four in stone, striking across to Pall
Mall. "There was a halcyon time in England, fifty years or
so ago, when, if you'll believe what men wrote, it was seriously
held that no civilized man would ever again encroach
upon a weaker brother's rights! Æons were at hand of universal
education, stained glass, and ascension lilies. At any
rate æons of brotherhood. Under the kindly control of the
great Elder Brother England. And they had some reason&mdash;it
looked for an illusory moment that way. I always try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
remember that&mdash;and moments like that in every land's
history&mdash;at moments such as these. Why doesn't that
moment carry on over? There's something deeply, fundamentally
wrong."</p>

<p>He looked along the crowded street. Men were buying
papers&mdash;that seemed their chief employment. <i>Delarey&mdash;Kitchener&mdash;Report
of fight at Hartz River.</i></p>

<p>"Not far from a billion dollars expended on this war&mdash;and
those East Side streets we went through yesterday&mdash;Concentration
Camps&mdash;and the Coronation&mdash;this reactionary
Administration with its Corn Laws and Coercion Laws and
wretched Education Bill, and so on&mdash;and the Coronation
talk&mdash;and Piccadilly last night after nine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Molly sharply. "That's the sting that I feel!
It's women and children who are suffering in those Concentration
Camps, I suppose&mdash;and it's women's sons who are
lying on the battlefields&mdash;and it's women just as well as
men who are paying the taxes&mdash;and it's women, too, in
those horrible slums, wretched and hopeless&mdash;and bad legislation
falls on women just as hardly as on men&mdash;but the
other! There we've got the tragedy mostly to ourselves&mdash;and
there's no greater tragedy below the stars!" She dashed
a bright drop from her eyes. "I'll never forget that girl,
last night, on the Embankment&mdash;thin and painted and
that hollow laugh.... I wish women would wake up!"</p>

<p>"Women and men," said the other. "They're waking, but
it's slow, it's slow, it's slow."</p>

<p>The softened, softened English sunlight bathed the broad
street, the buildings, the wheeled traffic, the people going up
and down. The two Americans, here at last at the latter end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of their six months abroad, delighted in the tender light,
in the soft afternoon sky with a few sailing clouds, in the
street sights and sounds, in the English speech. They strolled
rather than walked; even at times they dawdled rather than
strolled. They developed a tendency to stand before shop-windows.
So strong and handsome a pair were they that
they attracted some attention. Thirty-five and thirty-two,
both tall, both well-made, lithe, active, both aglow with
health; she a magnificent rosy blonde, he blue-eyed, but with
nut-brown hair; both dressed with an unconventional simplicity,
fitness, and comfort; both interested as children and happy
in each other's company&mdash;those who observed them did not
call them "Promise-Bearers"; and yet, in a way, that was
what they were. There were three children at home with as
splendid a grandmother. A University had sent Christopher
to make an investigation, and the children had said, "You
go, too, mother! It'll be splendid. You need a rest!" and
Christopher had said, "Molly, you need another honeymoon."</p>

<p>The English weather was uncommonly good. As they
came to Green Park a barrel-organ was playing. Spring was
full at hand; you read it everywhere.</p>

<p>Two men passed, talking. "Yes, to confer at Klerksdorp,
with Steyn and Botha and De Wet. Peace presently, and
none too soon!"</p>

<p>"I should think not. I'm done with wars."</p>

<p>"Little Annie Rooney," played the barrel-organ.</p>

<p>"There is more than one way for societies to survive,"
said Christopher, "and some day men will find it out. You
can survive by being a better duellist and for a longer time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
than the other fellow&mdash;and you can survive by being the
better toiler, also with persistence&mdash;or you can survive by
being the better thinker, in an endless, ascending scale. Each
plane makes the lower largely unnecessary, is, indeed, the
lower moved up, become more merciful and wiser. Survive&mdash;to
live over&mdash;to outlive. The true survivor&mdash;wouldn't
you like to see him&mdash;see her&mdash;see <i>us</i>, Molly?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Molly soberly. "We are a long way off."</p>

<p>Christopher assented. "True enough. And, thank Heaven!
the true survivor will always vanish toward the truer yet.
But I don't know&mdash;it seems to me&mdash;the twentieth century
might catch a faint far glimpse of our lineaments! I am
madly, wildly, rashly optimistic for the twentieth century&mdash;even
when I remember how optimistic they were fifty
years ago! Who could help being optimistic on such an afternoon?
Look at the gold on the green!"</p>

<p>The barrel-organ played an old, gay dance.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," said Molly, "that, in Merry England,
the milkmaids and shepherdesses danced about a maypole
at thirty-two? For that's just exactly what I should like to
do this minute! How absurd to be able to climb the Matterhorn,
and then not to be let go out there and dance on that
smooth bit of green!"</p>

<p>"You might try it. Only I wouldn't answer for the conduct
of the policeman by the tree. And if you're arrested,
we can't dine to-night with Roger Michael."</p>

<p>Roger Michael lived in a small, red, Georgian house in
Chelsea. Her grandparents had lived here, and her parents,
and she had been born here, nearer fifty than forty years ago.
It had descended to her, and she lived here still. She had an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
old housekeeper and a beautiful cat, and two orphan children
who were almost the happiest children in that part of
the world. She always kept children in the house. There
were a couple of others whom she had raised and who were
out in the world, doing well, and when the two now with her
were no longer children she would find another two. She did
not believe in orphan asylums. She herself had never married.</p>

<p>She remembered George Eliot, and she had known the
Rossettis, and more slightly the Carlyles. Now in her small,
distinguished house, with its atmosphere of plain living and
high thinking, fragrant and sunny with kindliness and good
will, she set her table often for her friends and drew them
together in her simple, old-fashioned, book-overflowing
drawing-room. Her friends were scholars, writing and thinking
people, and simply good people, and any one who was in
trouble and came to her, and many reformers. She was herself
of old, reforming stock, and she served humanity in all
those ways. She had met and liked the Josslyns when she
was in America years before, and when they wrote and told
her they were in London she promptly named this evening
for them to come to Chelsea.</p>

<p>They found besides Roger Michael a scientific man of name
asked to meet Christopher, a writer of plays, a writer of essays,
a noted Fabian, and as noted a woman reformer. The
seventh guest was a little late. When she came, it was Hagar
Ashendyne.</p>

<p>"What an unexpected pleasure!" said the Josslyns, and
meant every word of it. "How long since that summer at
the New Springs? Almost nine years! And you've grown a
great, famous woman&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not so very great, and not so very famous," said Hagar
Ashendyne. "But I'm fortunate enough&mdash;to-night! You're
a wind from home&mdash;you mountain-climbing, divine couple!
The Bear's Den! Do you remember the day we climbed
there?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Molly; "and Judge Black waiting at the foot.
Oh, I am glad to see you! We did not dream you were in
London."</p>

<p>"We&mdash;my father and I&mdash;have been here only a little
while. All winter we were in Algeria. Then, suddenly, he
wanted to see the Leonardos in the National."</p>

<p>Her voice, which was very rich and soft, made musical
notes of her words. She was subtly, indescribably, transfigured
and magnified. She looked a great woman. While
she turned to greet others in the room, one or two of whom
seemed acquaintances of more or less old standing, Molly
and Christopher were alike engaged in drawing rapidly into
mind what they knew of this countrywoman. They knew
what the world knew&mdash;that she was a writer of short
stories whose work would probably live; that her work was
fabulously in demand; that it had a metaphysical value as
well as a clutching interest. They knew that she was a
world-wanderer, sailing here and there over the globe with
a father whose insatiable zest for life crutches and wheel-chair
could not put under. It was their impression that she
had not been in America more than once or twice in a number
of years. They read everything she published; they
knew what could be known that way. They had that one
summer's impression and memory. She was there still; she
was that Hagar Ashendyne also, but evolved, enriched....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Roger Michael never had large dinner-parties, and the
talk was oftenest general. The fare that she spread was very
simple; it was enough and good; it gained that recognition,
and then the attention went elsewhere. The eight at the
round table were, through a long range, harmoniously
minded; half, at least, were old friends and comrades, and
the other half came easily to a meeting-place. Thought, become
articulate with less difficulty than usual, wove with
ductileness across and across the table. There sounded a fair
deal of laughter. They were all workers here, and, necessarily,
toward many issues, serious-minded enough. But
they could talk shop, and one another's shop, and shop of the
world at large, with humour and quick appreciation of the
merrier aspects of the workroom. At first, naturally, in a
time of public excitement, they talked the war in Africa, and
the sick longing the country now felt for peace, and the general
public foreboding, undefined but very real, that had
taken the place of the old, too-mellow complacency; but
then, as naturally in this company, the talk went to underlying,
slow, hesitant movements, evolutionary forces just
"a-borning"; roads that people such as these were blazing,
and athwart which each reactionary swing of the pendulum
brought landslides and floods enough, mountains of obstruction,
gulfs of not-yet-ness. But the roadmakers, the pioneers,
had the pioneer temper; they were spinning ropes, shouldering
picks, stating to themselves and one another that gulfs
had been crossed before and mountains removed, and that,
on the whole, it was healthful exercise. They were incurably
hopeful, though at quite long range, as reformers have
to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The Fabian told a mirth-provoking anecdote of a Tory
candidate. The scientific man, who possessed an imagination
and was a member of the Society for Psychical Research,
gave a brief account of Thomson's new Theory of Corpuscles,
and hazarded the prediction that the next quarter-century
would see remarkable things. "We'll know more about radiation&mdash;gravity&mdash;the
infinitely little and the infinitely big.
And then&mdash;my hobby. There's a curious increase of interest
in the question of a Fourth Dimension. It's a strange
age, and it's going to be stranger still&mdash;or merely beautifully
simple and homecoming, I don't know which. Science and
mysticism are fairly within hailing distance of each other."
The talk went to Christopher's investigation, and then to
mountain-climbing, and Cecil Rhodes's Will, and Marconi's
astonishing feat of receiving in Newfoundland wireless signals
from a station on the English coast, and M. Santos-Dumont's
flight in a veritable airship. The writer of essays,
who was a woman and an earnest and loving one, had recently
published a paper upon a term that had hardly as yet
come into general use&mdash;<i>Eugenics</i>; an article as earnest and
loving as herself. Roger Michael had liked it greatly, and
so had others at the table. Now they made the writer go
over a point or two, which she did quietly, elaborating what
she had first said.</p>

<p>Only the writer of plays&mdash;his last one being at the moment
in the hands of the censor&mdash;chose to be strangely,
deeply, desperately pessimistic. "I am going," he said, "to
quote Huxley&mdash;not that I couldn't say it as well myself.
Says Huxley, 'I know of no study which is so unutterably
saddening as that of the evolution of humanity.... Out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the darkness of prehistoric ages man emerges with the mark
of his lowly origin strong upon him. He is a brute, more intelligent
than other brutes; a blind prey to impulses which,
as often as not, lead him to destruction; a victim to endless
illusions which make his mental existence a terror and a burthen
and fill his physical life with barren toil and battle. He
attains a certain degree of comfort and develops a more or
less workable theory of life ... and then for thousands of years
struggles with varying fortunes, attended by infinite wickedness,
bloodshed, and misery, to maintain himself at that point
against the greed and ambition of his fellow-men. He makes
a point of killing and otherwise persecuting all those who
first try to get him to move on; and when he has moved a
step farther, foolishly confers <i>post-mortem</i> deification on his
victims. He exactly repeats the process with all who want
him to move a step yet farther.'&mdash;That," said the writer of
plays, "is what happens to brains, aspiration, and altruism
in combination&mdash;rack and thumbscrews and auto-da-fés,
and maybe in five hundred years or a thousand a picture
skied by the Royal Academy&mdash;'Giordano Bruno going to
the Stake,' 'Galileo Recanting,' 'Joan of Arc before her
Judges.' My own theory of the world is that it is standing
on its head. Naturally it resents the presence of people
whose heads are in the clouds. Naturally it finds them rather
ridiculous and contrary to all the proprieties, and violently
to be pulled down. Moral: keep your brains close to safety
and the creeping herb."</p>

<p>"I think that you worry," said the Fabian, "much too much
about that play. I don't believe there's the slightest prospect
that he'll think it fit to be produced."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman reformer was talking with Molly. "Yes; it's a
long struggle. We've been at it since the 'fifties&mdash;just as
you have been in America. A long, long time. The Movement
in both countries is a grey-haired woman of almost sixty
years. We've needed what they say we have&mdash;patience.
Sometimes I think we've been too patient. You younger
women have got to come in and take hold and give what perhaps
the older type couldn't give&mdash;organization and wider
knowledge and modern courage. We've given the old-time
courage all right, and you'll have to have the patience and
staying qualities, too;&mdash;but there's needed now a higher
heart and a freer step than we could give in that world that
we're coming out of."</p>

<p>"I think that I've always thought it right," said Molly,
"but I've never really come out and said so, or become identified
in any way.&mdash;Of course, it isn't thinking so very positively
if you haven't done that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is like that with almost every one. Diffused thought&mdash;and
then, suddenly one day, something happens or another
mind touches yours, and out of the mist there gathers
form, determination, action. You're all right, my dear!
Only, I hope when you go home you will speak out, join some
organization&mdash;That is the simple, right thing that every
one can do. Concerted effort is the effort that tells to-day."</p>

<p>"Are you speaking," asked Hagar Ashendyne, "of the
Suffrage Movement?"</p>

<p>They were back in the drawing-room, all gathered more or
less closely around a light fire upon the hearth, kindled for
the comfort of Americans who always found England "so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
cold." It softened and brightened all the room, quaint and
old-fashioned, where, for a hundred years, distinguished
quiet people had come and gone.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the older woman. "Are you interested?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>She had not spoken much at dinner, but had sat, a pearl of
listeners, deep, soft eyes upon each discourser in turn. There
was in the minds of all an interest and curiosity regarding
her. Her work was very good. She had personality to an
extraordinary degree.</p>

<p>Now she spoke in a voice that had a little of the Ashendyne
golden drawl. "I have been&mdash;in the last eight years&mdash;oh,
all over! Europe, yes; but more especially, it seems to me,
looking back, the Orient. Egypt, all North Africa, Turkey
and Persia, Japan and India. Yes, and Europe, too; Greece
and Italy and Spain, the mid-Continent and the North.
Around the world&mdash;a little of Spanish America, a little of
the Islands. Sometimes long in one place, sometimes only a
few days.... Everywhere it was always the same.... The
Social Organism with a shrivelled side."</p>

<p>The writer of plays was in a mood to take issue with his
every deepest conviction; also to say banal things. "But
aren't American women the freest in the world?"</p>

<p>Hagar Ashendyne did not answer. She sat in a deep armchair,
her elbow upon the arm, her chin in her hand, her eyes
dreaming upon the fire....</p>

<p>But Christopher entered the lists. "'Freest'&mdash;'freest'!
Yes, perhaps they are. The Italian woman is freer than
the Oriental woman, and the German woman is freer than
the Italian, and the English woman is freer than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
German, and the American is freer than the English! But
what have they to do with 'freer' and 'freest'? It is a
question of being free!"</p>

<p>"Free politically?"</p>

<p>"Free in all human ways, politically being one. I do not
see how a man can endure to say to a woman, 'You are less
free than I am, but be satisfied! you are so much freer than
that wretch over there!'"</p>

<p>Hagar rose. Her eyes chanced to meet those of the man
who had talked physics and mysticism. "We shan't," she
said, "get into the Fourth Dimension while we have a
shrivelled side. We can't limp into that, you know." She
crossed the room and stood before a portrait hung above
a sofa. "Roger Michael, come tell me about this Quaker
lady!"</p>

<p>She left before ten, pleading an early rising for work that
must be done. And Molly and Christopher would come to
see her? She might be a month in London.</p>

<p>Christopher and the Fabian saw her into her cab, and she
gave each her hand and was driven away. "That," said the
Fabian, as they turned back to the house, "is a woman one
could die for."</p>

<p>It was a long way to the hotel where the Ashendynes were
staying. A mild, dark, blurred night; street lights, houses
with lights and darkened houses, forms on the pavement
that moved briskly, forms that idled, forms that went with
stealthiness; passing vehicles, the horses' hoofs, the roll of
the wheels, the onward, unfolding ribbon of the night. The
air came in at the lowered window, soft and cool, with a
hint now of rain. Hagar was dreaming of Gilead Balm. Up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
over the threshold had peered a childhood evening, and she
and Thomasine and Maggie and Corker and Mary Magazine
played ring-around-a-rosy, over the dewy grass until
the pink in the west was ashes of roses and the fireflies
were out.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

HAGAR IN LONDON</h2>


<p>"I have been re-reading Humboldt," said Medway Ashendyne.
"What do you say, Gipsy, to risking a South American
Revolution? Venezuela&mdash;Colombia&mdash;Sail from New
York in September&mdash;and if you wanted ten days at Gilead
Balm&mdash;"</p>

<p>Their drawing-room looked pleasantly out over gardens;
indeed, so closely came the trees, there was a green and shimmering
light in the room. It was May, and the sounds of the
London streets floated pleasantly in at the open windows
with the pleasant morning breeze. The waiter had taken
away Medway's breakfast paraphernalia. Hagar had breakfasted
much earlier. Thomson stood at the back of the room
arranging upon a small table, which presently would be
moved within reach of Medway's hand, smoking apparatus,
papers, magazines, and what not. That eight-years-past prolonged
sojourn and convalescence in Egypt had produced a
liking for Mahomet, and Medway had annexed him as he
annexed all possible things that he liked and that could
serve him. Mahomet, speaking English now, but still in the
costume of the East, had just brought in a pannier of flowers.
They were all over the room, in tall vases. "Too many," said
Hagar's eyes; but Medway who, when he was in search of the
rarefied pleasure of adventure and novelty in strange and
barbarous places, could be as ascetic as a red Indian on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
warpath, loved, when he rocked in the trough of the waves,
to rock in a bower.</p>

<p>"Cartagena would be our port. There's a railroad, I believe,
to Calamar. Then up the Magdalena by some kind
of a steamboat to Giradot. Then get to Bogotá as best we
might. There's an interesting life there, eight thousand feet
above the sea, with schools and letters, and governments in
and governments out, and cool mountain water running
downwards through the city, and the houses built low because
of the earthquakes. Let us go up the Magdalena and across
to Bogotá, Gipsy!"</p>

<p>He sat in the wheel-chair he had himself designed, a wonderfully
light and graceful affair,&mdash;considering,&mdash;with
wonderful places alongside and beneath for wonderful things.
His crutches were there, slung alongside, ready to his hand,
and wicker detachable receptacles for writing-things and
sketching-block and pencils and the book he was reading
and so forth. Where he travelled now, the wheel-chair must
travel. He was good with crutches for a hundred paces or
two; then he must sit down and gather force for the next
hundred. He suffered at times&mdash;not at all constantly&mdash;a
good deal of pain. But with all of this understood, he yet
looked a vigorous person,&mdash;fresh, hale, well-favoured, with
not a grey hair,&mdash;a young man still.</p>

<p>"Bogotá," he said, "An archiepiscopal see&mdash;universities,
libraries, and a botanic garden. Shut-in and in-growing
meridional culture, tempered by revolutions. By all means
let us go to Bogotá, Gipsy!"</p>

<p>Hagar smiled, sat without speaking, waiting, her eyes
upon Thomson putting the last touches to the table, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Mahomet thrusting long-stemmed irises into the vases, the
faces of both discreetly masking whatever interest they
might feel in the proposed itinerary.</p>

<p>When, after another minute or two, they were gone from
the room, "Were you waiting for them to go? Why, who
keeps anything from Thomson? He knows my innermost soul.
I told him this morning I was thinking of South America."</p>

<p>Hagar rose, and with her hands behind her head, began
slowly to pace the large room. "Bogotá <i>qua</i> Bogotá is all
right. You've the surest instinct, of course, when it comes
to matching your mood with your place. You're a marvel
there, as you are in so many ways, father! And Thomson
and Mahomet would like it, too, I think."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you won't like it?"</p>

<p>"No. I should like it very much. But I am not going,
father."</p>

<p>Medway made an impatient movement, "We have had
this before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but not so determinedly.... Why not agree that
the battle is over? It <i>is</i> over."</p>

<p>"And you rest the conqueror?"</p>

<p>"In this&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"I could see," said Medway, "some point in it if the
existence you lead with me made the fulfilment of your
undoubted talent&mdash;your genius, perhaps&mdash;impossible. But
you write wherever we go. You work steadily."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hagar, "but the work by which you live is
not all of life."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that you have touched life at a good many
points in these eight years."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"Being with you," said Hagar, "has been a liberal education."
She laughed with soft, deliberate merriment, but she
meant what she said. From a slender green vase she took an
iris, and coming to the wheel-chair knelt down and drew the
long stalk through the appropriate buttonhole. "You must
have as large a bouquet as that!" she said. "Yes, a university
and a training-ship! I can never be sufficiently grateful!"</p>

<p>They both laughed. "Well, you've paid your way!" he
said; "literally and metaphorically. I suppose two gratitudes
cancel each other&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leaving an understanding friendship." She grew graver.
"A good deal of love, too. I want you to realize that." She
laughed again. "I do not always approve you, you know,
but, thank God! I can love without always approving!"</p>

<p>Medway nodded. "I like a tolerant woman."</p>

<p>She rose and stood, regarding him with a twisted smile,
affectionate and pitying. "I think that you are a fearfully
selfish man&mdash;to quote Stevenson, quoted by Henley, 'an
unconscious, easy, selfish person.' And I think that, of your
own brand, you have grit and pluck and stamina for twenty
men. There's no malice or envy in you, and you're intellectually
honest, and you can be the best company in the world.
I am very fond of you."</p>

<p>"Aren't you the selfish person not to be willing to go to
Bogotá?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;" said Hagar Ashendyne, "but I
am not willing."</p>

<p>"What is it that you do want?"</p>

<p>"That is the first time you have asked me that.... Wandering
is good, but it is not good for all of life. I want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
return to my own country and to live there. I want to grow
in my native forest and serve in my own place."</p>

<p>"To live at Gilead Balm with Bob and Serena?"</p>

<p>"No; I do not mean that precisely." Hagar pushed back
her heavy hair. "I haven't thought it out perfectly. But it
has grown to be wrong to me, personally, to wander, wander
forever like this&mdash;irresponsible, brushing life with moth
wings.... If I saw any end to it ... but I do not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you wish to cut the painter? This comes," said
Medway, "of the damned modern independence of women.
If you couldn't write&mdash;couldn't earn&mdash;you'd trot along
quietly enough! The pivotal mistake was letting women
learn the alphabet."</p>

<p>"I could always have taken a position as housemaid,"
said Hagar serenely. "You can't make me angry, and so get
the best of me. And you like me better, knowing the alphabet,
and there's no use in your denying it.... If only you
would conceive that it were possible for you to return to
America, to take a house, to <i>live</i> there. And still you could
travel&mdash;sometimes with me, sometimes without me&mdash;travel
often if you pleased and far and wide.... Would it
be so distasteful?"</p>

<p>"Profoundly so," said Medway. "It is idle to talk of it. I
should be bored to extinction.&mdash;What is your alternative?"</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to spend three months out of every year
with you."</p>

<p>"Is that your last word?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Suppose you do not begin the arrangement until next
year? Then we can still go to Bogotá."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you so wild to go to Bogotá?"</p>

<p>"All life," said Medway, "is based upon compromise."</p>

<p>Hagar, pacing to and fro, in her soft dull-green cotton with
its fine deep collar of valenciennes, stopped now before the
purple irises and now before the white. "Had I not appeared
by your bedside in Alexandria, eight years ago, had I not
been at hand during that convalescence for you to grow a
little fond of, you would have, all these years, taken Thomson
and Mahomet and gone to every place where we have
gone, just the same,&mdash;just the same,&mdash;and with, I hardly
doubt, just as full enjoyment. If you had not liked me, you
would, with the entirest equanimity, have bidden me good-bye
and seen me return with grandfather to Gilead Balm,
and you would have travelled on, finding and making friends,
acquaintances, and servants as you do to so remarkable a
degree, missing not one station or event. If I died to-day,
you would do every proper thing&mdash;and in the autumn proceed
to Bogotá."</p>

<p>"Granting all that," said Medway, "it remains that I find
and have found in the past a pleasure in your company.&mdash;I
am going to remind you again, Gipsy, that all life is compromise."</p>

<p>Hagar, at the window, in the green and shimmering light
like the bottom of the sea, leaned her forehead against the
sash and looked across into the leafy gardens. Children
were there, playing and calling. A young girl passed, carrying
smart bandboxes; then an old woman, stooping, using a
cane, with her a great dog and a young woman in the dress of
a nurse. The soft rumble and crying of the city droned in together
with a bee that made for the nearest flower. Hagar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
turned. "I will go with you for another year, father, but after
that, I will go home."</p>

<p>"No end of things," said Medway, "can happen in a year.
I never cross a bridge that's three hundred and sixty-five
days away.&mdash;I'd advise you, if you haven't already done so,
to read Humboldt."</p>

<p>He had a luncheon engagement, and at twelve vanished,
Thomson and Mahomet in attendance. This drawing-room,
his large chamber and bath, an adjoining room with its own
entrance for Thomson, quarters somewhere for Mahomet,
were his; he paid for them. Hagar had two rooms, her bedroom,
and a much smaller drawing-room. They were hers;
she paid for them. After the first two years she had assumed
utterly her own support. Medway had shrugged. "As you
choose&mdash;"</p>

<p>Now, in her own rooms, she wrote through the early afternoon,
then, rising, weighted the sheets of manuscript with a
jade Buddha, put on a street dress, and went out into the
divine, mild May weather. She knew people in London; she
had acquaintances, engagements; but to-day was free. She
walked a long way, the air was so sweet, and at last she
found herself before Westminster Abbey. After a moment's
hesitation she went in. The great, crowded place was empty,
almost, of the living; a few tourist figures flitted vaguely. She
moved slowly, over the dust of the dead, between the dull,
encumbering marbles, until she reached a corner that she
liked. Sitting here, her head a little thrown back against the
stone, her soul opened the gates of Quiet. Rose and purple
light sifted down from the great windows; all about was the
dim thought of dead kings and queens, soldiers, poets, men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the state. In the organ loft some one touched the organ keys.
A few chords were sounded, then the vibration ceased.</p>

<p>Hagar sat very still, her eyes closed. Her soul was searching,
searching, not tumultuously, but quietly, quietly. It
touched the past, here and there, and lighted it up; days and
nights, dreams, ambitions, aspirations. Some dreams, some
ambitions were in the way of fulfilment. Medway Ashendyne
was within her; she, too, knew <i>Wanderlust</i>&mdash;"for to
admire an' for to see." She had wandered and had seen.
She would always love to wander, crave for to see and to admire.... To
write&mdash;to earn&mdash;to write.... Her lips curved
into the slightest smile. The old days and nights when she
had wondered, wondered if that would ever come to pass, if it
ever <i>could</i> come to pass! It had come to pass. To do better
work, and always better work&mdash;that was a continuing impulse;
but it was still and steady now, not fevered.... Her
mind swept with wider wings. To know, to learn, to gain in
content and in fineness, to gather being, knowledge, wisdom,
bliss&mdash;to gather, and then from her granary to give the increase,
that was the containing, the undying desire. She had
a strange passion for the future, for all that might become.
She was sensitive to the wild and scattered motion within
the Whole, atom colliding with atom, blind-man's-buff&mdash;all
looking for the outlet into freedom, power, glory; all groping,
beating the air with unclutching hands, missing the outlet,
it was perhaps so small. She thought of an expression of
George Meredith's, "To see the lynx that sees the light."
To see it&mdash;to follow&mdash;to help find the opening.... What
was needed was direction, and then unity of movement, the
atoms in one stream, resistless. That, when the lightning bolt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
went across the sky, was what happened; corpuscles streaming
freely, going side by side, not face against face, not
energy dashing itself endlessly against energy. It was all one,
physical and psychic; power lay in community of understanding.... Public
Opinion, community of understanding,
minds moving in a like direction, power resulting, power to
accomplish mighty and mightier things.... Then do your
best to ennoble Public Opinion. Do not think whether your
best is little or great; do your best....</p>

<p>She opened her eyes upon the light sifting down from the
rose windows. It was shortening, the shaft; evening was at
hand in the church of the great dead. Many who lay there
had had within them a lynx that saw the light and had tried
to bring the mass of their being to follow; many had ennobled
the world-mind, one this way and one that; each had brought
to the vast granary his handful of wheat. Ruby and amethyst,
the light lay athwart the pillars like an ethereal stair.
The organist touched the organ again. A verger came down
the aisle; it was closing time. Hagar rose and went out into
what sunshine lay over London.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

BY THE SEA</h2>


<p>But after all they did not go to Bogotá. That autumn a
revolution flared up in Colombia. Medway considered the
matter, but finally shrugged and shook his head. His point
gained and Bogotá prepared for, he gave the idea up "for
this time" with entire nonchalance. But they were in New
York by now, and something must be done. He went with
Hagar to Gilead Balm for two weeks&mdash;going home for the
second time in eight years. The first time had been perhaps
two years after his accident. Old Miss had cried out so to
him to come, had so passionately besought him to let her see
him again, and Hagar had so steadfastly supported her
claim, that at last he gave in and went. He spent two months
at Gilead Balm, and he had been gracious and considerate
to all the family with an extra touch for his mother. But
when he went away he evidently considered that he had
done all that mortal could ask, and though Old Miss continued
to write to him every three months, and though she
always said, "And when are you coming home?" she never
so urged the matter again.</p>

<p>Now he went with Hagar down through the late autumn
country to his birthplace, and stayed for a fortnight, as
unruffled, debonair, and dominant as before. The Colonel
and Old Miss had each of them years enough now; as age is
counted they were old. But each came of a long-lived stock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and they held their own to a marvel. Hagar could see the
difference the years had made, but there was no overwhelming
difference. The Colonel did not ride so far, and Old Miss,
though she jealously guarded her key-basket and abated
authority not a jot, was less active than of old. She had
grown rather deaf, and Medway avoided much conversation
with her. Captain Bob was more broken; he looked
older than the elder brother. Luna was dead long ago, and
he had another hound, Lisa. He was fond of Lisa and Lisa
of him, but Lisa was not Luna, and he was very faithful to
Luna's memory and always telling stories of her intelligence
and exploits. Miss Serena had changed very little. Mrs. Green
was dead, and the overseer's house at the moment stood
empty. Car'line was dead, too, but Mary Magazine kept
house for Isham. Hagar walked down to the ferry, and she
and Mary Magazine talked about the old flower dolls and the
hayloft, and the cavern by the spring. She walked by herself
upon the ridge, and sat under the cucumber tree, and
went to the north side, and, leaning against the beech, which
had grown to be a good-sized tree, looked down the long
slope to the hollow and streamlet, the sunken boulder and
thicket.</p>

<p>The two weeks passed. Indian summer held throughout
November. "This dreamy place makes you disinclined to
vigorous planning," said Medway. "I think, Gipsy, that we
will drift on down through Florida, and cross to Cuba."</p>

<p>This year there were evidently cross-winds. At Palm
Beach, Medway came upon an old acquaintance, associate
of ancient days in Paris, an artist with whom he had rambled
through Fontainebleau forest and drunk good wine in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Barbizon. For years each had been to the other a thin memory;
now, almost with violence, the attraction renewed itself.
But the artist was not going to Cuba; he was going to the
Bahamas. He had a commission to paint a portrait, and his
subject, who was a Chicago multi-millionaire, had elected to
winter at Nassau and to give the sittings there. Commissions
evidently did not come every day to the artist, who was
post-post-impressionist, and he was quite willing to go to
Nassau, jubilantly so, in fact. He said that, for once, light
was going to be thrown upon the multi-millionaire.</p>

<p>Medway strove to persuade him to forfeit the commission
and go to Cuba; and he was even, it was evident, prepared
to make the proceeding no financial loss. But the artist
stated explicitly that he had a sense of honour and could
not leave the Chicagoan in the lurch; besides he wanted to
paint that portrait. "Come and see me do it, old fellow!
I'm going to take a reasonable small house with a garden,
knock out partitions and make a studio. One commission
leads to another:&mdash;Light on the whole bunch.&mdash;Oh, I'm
told that you've got a million, too! How the devil did you
get into that galley?" In the end, rather than part with
the old companion, Medway exchanged Cuba for the Bahamas.</p>

<p>Thomson found a house that he thought would answer.
Hagar went with him to see it, and agreed that it would.
Both spoke entirely with reference to Medway. Back at the
great hotel, she explained its advantages. "There's a pleasing,
tangled garden, palms and orange trees and hibiscus, and
a high garden wall. The verandahs, upper and lower, are
wide. You get the air, and you have, besides the town, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
great sweep of this turquoise sea. There's only a short, quiet,
easy street between the house and Mr. Greer's studio. I
think that it will answer."</p>

<p>It answered very well as Medway granted. He and Greer
were much together. The Chicagoan, when he arrived, proved
to be a good fellow, too, earnest in his endeavour to play
blotting-paper to culture. Greer gathered from the hotel
several congenial Americans. Medway, who always had the
best of letters, provided an Englishman or two from the
more or less stationary Government set. The studio became
practically his and Greer's in common; they were extraordinarily
good talkers and they rolled wonderful cigarettes and
Mahomet made <i>café fort</i>. A violinist of some note was stopping
at the hotel, and he and his violin added themselves to
the company. When a traveller who knew Lhasa, Bangkok,
and Baalbek, Knossos and Kairwan and Kandy, was joined
to the others, it became evident that Medway had made his
circle and found the winter's entertainment.</p>

<p>He had never made greatly too large demand upon Hagar's
hours. He was full of resources, supple in turning from person
to person of all his varied acquaintance in varied lands,
moderately appreciative, too, of the value of solitude. On
her side she would have stood, had there been need, for time
to herself. It was to her the very breath of life. But there
was never extreme need. She was within call when he wanted
to turn to her, and that was sufficient. But this winter, it
was evident, she would have her days to a greater extent
than usual in her own hand. There was never any accounting
to him for her days apart from him; almost from the first
there had obtained that relation of personal liberty. To do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
him justice he felt no desire to exact such an accounting, and
had he tried to do so he would have failed.</p>

<p>Hagar saw that she was going to have time, time this
winter; and, what she liked, they would be long enough in
one place to allow her to work with advantage. There would
be visitors, invitations&mdash;already they had begun:&mdash;Medway
would wish to give, now and then, a garden-party, a
dinner-party. But life would by no means run to an exchange
of visits and entertainments. Father and daughter had
alike, in this direction, the art of sufficient but not too much.
Anything beyond a certain, not-great amount wearied and
exasperated him, wearied and saddened her. All that would
be kept in bounds. Hagar, pacing the garden, saw quiet
days, surcharged with light.</p>

<p>She was thinking out her half-year's work. A volume of
stories, eight or ten in all&mdash;such a subject and such a subject;
such or such an incident, situation, value; such a man,
such a woman. She knew that her work was good, that it
was counted very good, counted to her for name and fame.
All that was something to her; rather, it was much to her;
but only positively so, not relatively. It could by no means
fill her universe. For years she had taken now this, now that
filament-like value and with skill and power had enlarged,
coloured, and arranged it so that her great audience might
also see; and she had done, she thought, service thereby;
had, in her place, served beauty and knowledge. But the
hunger grew to serve more fully. Knowledge, knowledge&mdash;wisdom,
wisdom&mdash;action....</p>

<p>Hagar moved to a stone seat that commanded an opening
in the garden wall. She looked out, down and over a short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
steep, dazzling white street and a swarm of low, pale-coloured,
chimneyless houses, with the green between of tropic trees,
to the surf upon the coral shore and the opaque, marvellous
blue of the surrounding sea. The creative passion was upon
her, but it moved nowadays as it had moved with many
an idealist-realist before.... To mould living material,
to deal with the objective, to deal with the living world, not
the world of bright-hued shadows; to see the living world
lighten to the dawn, see the dull hues brighten, see the
beautyless become beauty and beauty grow vivid, to see all
the world lift, lift toward the golden day, to see the race become
the over-race.... She would have died for that and
died to help. She laid her arms along the stone and her head
upon them. "And yet I do not help, or not with all that
is in me. I sit here to one side and spin fancies."</p>

<p>She rose, and put on a shady hat, and going out into the
dazzling white street moved down it, and then by another
across for some distance to the white road by the sea. Her
back to the town, she walked on. A few scattered palms, the
sea-wall; then where it ended, an edging tangle of the hard
green leaves of the sea-grape; outside of that, low fantastically
worn coral rock and the white dash and spray of the
water. Though the sun was high and the sky intense and
cloudless, a wind blew always; the air was dry and the
day not too warm. There was hardly anyone upon the road.
She met a cluster of negro children and talked with them a
little. A surrey, of the type that waited on the street near
the great hotels, passed her, driven sleepily by a sleepy negro,
within it a large man in white. When it was gone in a little
cloud of white dust there was only the long road, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
unyielding monotonous green of the sea-grape, and the water
thundering in an undertone. Hagar turned aside, broke
through the grape, and came down to the edge of the surf.
There was a rock hollowed until it made a rude chair. She
sat down and looked out to sea. On one hand, across the harbour
mouth, rose from a finger-narrow sliver of land, a squat
white lighthouse; but turn a little and look away and there
was only the open sea, unimaginably blue, azure as the sky.
The soft wind blew, the surf broke in low thunder. Hagar,
her chin upon her hand, sat for a long time, very still.</p>

<p>
"How good is man's life, the mere living&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p>It seemed true enough, sitting there in the sunshine, in the
heart of so rich a beauty. She agreed. How good it was,
how good it often was!&mdash;only, only.... The line was true,
perhaps, of all at some time, of some at all times&mdash;though
she doubted that&mdash;but never of all at all times. It was true
of a host at very few times; it was never so true of any as it
might be.</p>

<p>
"How good is man's life, the mere living!&mdash;how fit to employ<br />
All the heart and the soul and the senses forever in joy!"<br />
</p>

<p>Who felt that?&mdash;Not even the poets immemorial who so
sang&mdash;sang often in sadness of heart! They felt only the
promise that the future cast before her.</p>

<p>Association of ideas was so strong and quick within her
that she was apt to call up images, not singly, but in series
and sequences. Her mind swept away from the West Indian
sea. She saw her mother at Gilead Balm, beating her wings
against invisible bars; the woman on the packet-boat, racked
with anxiety, her child in her arms, begging her way to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
sick mate; the figure of the convict at the lock, Thomasine in
the silk mill, Omega Street.... She thought of Rachel and
her married life, of things which she had heard at the Settlement,
and the pain in Elizabeth Eden's eyes as she told them.
She thought of Eglantine and its insidious sapping, sapping ... of
Miss Serena and her stunted, small industries and too-obedient
soul. She thought of Miss Bedford, and of Francie
Smythe, and of Mrs. LeGrand. She seemed again to hear
Mrs. LeGrand upon Roger Michael. She thought of the
Bishop and the day he passed sentence upon a child for reading
a great book. She saw the thicket back of the ridge, and
dogs set by a human being upon a human being. She saw
winter streets in New York, and the light shining on the
three balls of the pawnbrokers, and a bread-line, and men
and women huddled on park benches while the wind shook
the leafless trees. She saw Wall Street and St. Timothy's.
Her mind passed overseas. Russia&mdash;three summers before
they had been there. Medway, though he laughed at her,
had agreed to a stepping aside which she proposed. She
wished to see Tolstoy. It was always easy to him to arrange
such things, and it had ended in their being invited for two
days to Yásnaya Polyána. She saw again the old man and
heard his slow words. <i>Non-resistance</i>&mdash;but his mind, through
his pen, was not non-resistant! It acted, it scourged, it fought,
it strove to build and to clear the ground that it might build.
He deceived himself, the tremendous old man. He thought
himself quietist as Lao-Tzu, but there in that bare, small
study he cried, <i>Allah! Allah!</i> and fought like a Mohammedan.
Russia and the burden of Russia ... the world and
the burden of the world. She thought of the East, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
now her mind entered Zenanas&mdash;of India, and it was the
child marriages; of Turkey, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, and it
was the veiled women, proclaimed without souls. She saw
the eunuchs at the gate. Away to Europe&mdash;and she saw
that concept grading away, but never quite gone, never
quite gone. Woman as mind undying, self-authoritative and
unrelated, the arbiter of her own destiny, the definer of her
own powers, with an equal goal and right-of-way&mdash;few were
the earthly places where that ray fell!</p>

<p>
"How good is man's life, the mere living&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p>"With vast modifications and withdrawals, with dross and
alloy," said Hagar. "But it might be&mdash;O, God, it might
be! Lift all desire and you lift the whole. Lift the present&mdash;steady,
steady!&mdash;and know that one day the future will
blossom. And a woman's work is now with women. Solidarity&mdash;unification&mdash;woman
at last for woman."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

DENNY GAYDE</h2>


<p>A few days after this she grew tired one morning of working.
At ten o'clock she put away paper and pencil, pen and ink,
letters and manuscript, and went out, first into the garden,
and then through the gate in the wall into the high white
light of the street and the pale-coloured town. Few were
abroad in this section; she gave a friendly nod to those she
met, but they were not many&mdash;an old negress carrying
chickens, a few slow wagons, a priest, a young girl and boy,
white-clad, with tennis rackets; two or three others. The
street swam in light, the blue vault above sprang intense,
there was just enough air to keep away languor. She turned
into the grounds of the old, closed Royal Victoria Hotel.
Here was shade and greater freshness. She sat down on the
rock coping of the driveway; then, as there was no one about,
lay down upon it pillowing her head on her arms. Above her
was a tall, tall tree, and between the branches the deep and
vivid blue. It seemed so near, it was as though with a little
upward effort you might touch a sapphire roof. Between the
leaves the sun scattered gold sequins. They lay upon her
white skirt, the hat she had discarded, her arms, her hair.
She looked sideways watching a chameleon, burnished and
slender, upon the wall below her. It saw her at last and with
a jerk of its head scuttled away. Hagar laughed, sat up and
stretched her arms. Some neighbouring, one-storey house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
buried in foliage, possessed a parrot or cockatoo. She
watched it now, on some hidden perch, a vivid splash of
colour in the enfolding green, dancing about, chattering and
screaming. Some curious, exotic fragrance came to her; she
could not trace its source. "It's a morning for the gods!"
she said, and walked slowly by winding paths downward
through the garden to the street. Before her, seen through
foliage, rose the curiously shaped building with a history
where now was lodged the public library. She had visited it
several times; she liked the place, which had a quaintness,
and liked the way the air blew in through its deep windows;
and where books were she was at home. She crossed the
white street, entered and went up the stair past dusty casts,
pieces of coral and sea-curios, and into the round room
where English and American papers and magazines were
spread upon a table. From this centre sprang, like short
spokes, alcoves made by the book-stacks. Each of these divisions
had its chair or two and its open window. The air
came in coolly, deliciously. There were the librarian and two
or three people standing or seated about the central table,&mdash;no
one else in the cool, quiet place. Hagar, too, stood by the
table for a while, turning over the January magazines, looking
at the table of contents or glancing at some article or
illustration. Catholicism versus Ultramontanism&mdash;Why Ireland
is Disloyal&mdash;Drama of the Future&mdash;The Coal Strike
and its Lessons&mdash;Labour and the Trusts&mdash;Labour and
Capital&mdash;Municipalization of Public Services&mdash;The Battleship
of the Future&mdash;The War against Disease&mdash;Tschaikowsky
and Tolstoy&mdash;Mankind in the Making&mdash;Mendel's
Law&mdash;The Advancement of Woman&mdash;The Woman who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Toils&mdash;Variation in Man and Woman&mdash;Genesis of the
Æsthetic Categories&mdash;New Metaphysical Movement&mdash;Inversion
of Ideas as to the Structure of the Universe&mdash;The
World and the Individual.&mdash;After a while she left these
and the table and moved to one of the alcoves. It was not a
day somehow for magazines. The rows of books! Her gaze
lingered with fondness upon them&mdash;this familiar title, this
loved old friend and that. Finally she drew forth a volume
of Keats, and with it sat down in the sweet air from the
window.</p>

<div class="poem">
"No, no! go not to Lethe, neither twist<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wolf'sbane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<p>An hour passed. A man, who had come into the room a few
minutes before, was standing, looking about him&mdash;evidently
the first time he had been in the building.</p>

<p>The librarian joined him. "It's a pleasant old place, isn't
it?" she said politely.</p>

<p>"It certainly is," answered the man. "But it's so curious
with that narrow stair and these deep-set windows."</p>

<p>"Yes. You see it's the old jail. Once they kept men here
instead of books."</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then the man said, "This is the
nobler use, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said the librarian; "but of course they were wicked
men&mdash;that is, most of them. There wasn't anything else
to do with them."</p>

<p>"I see," said the man. He looked about him. "Well, it's
sweet and clean and useful now at last!"</p>

<p>Some one called the librarian and she went away. The
man moved on with slow steps from alcove to alcove. Hagar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
from her recess, watched him, fascinated. Her book had
fallen upon the floor. With half of her mind she was again in
a poor hall in New York on a winter night.... Five or six
people entered the library together. They came between her
and the man she was following with her eyes. When at last
they moved from before her alcove, she saw him leaving the
place. Before she could hastily rise and come out into the
wider space he was out of the room upon the landing&mdash;he
was going downstairs. She caught up the book from the
floor, thrust it hurriedly into its place, and with a light and
rapid step followed. He was at the foot of the stair when she
reached the head.</p>

<p>"Oh," she called, "will you stop&mdash;will you wait?"</p>

<p>He stopped short, turned. She was halfway down the stair,
which was not long. "I beg your pardon. Was it to me you
were speaking?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" She came up with him&mdash;they stood together in
the light-washed doorway. "I&mdash;You do not remember
me." She put up her hand and took off her wide hat of straw
and lace. "Do you, now?"</p>

<p>He gazed. "No&mdash;Yes! Wait.... Oh&mdash;h! You are the
little girl again!"</p>

<p>They both laughed with pure pleasure. A soft, bright
swirl of feeling enfolded the ancient doorway.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "I have so often thought of you!"</p>

<p>"Not oftener than I have thought of you.... You've
always been like a quaint, bright picture and a piece of music
in my mind.&mdash;I don't know your name."</p>

<p>"Hagar Ashendyne.&mdash;And I don't know yours."</p>

<p>"Denny Gayde.... I tried to find you in the crowd that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
night&mdash;the night of the meeting, you remember&mdash;but you
were gone."</p>

<p>"Yes. And for weeks after that night I used to think that
perhaps I might meet you on the street any day. And then I
went away."</p>

<p>The sun was dazzling where they stood. People, too, were
coming down the stairs behind them.</p>

<p>"Let us go somewhere where we can talk," said Hagar;
"the gardens over there&mdash;have you time?"</p>

<p>"I'm here on a holiday. I came yesterday. I don't know a
soul and I was lonely. I've all the time there is."</p>

<p>They crossed the street, passed under an arch of blossoming
vines, and entered the Royal Victoria's garden&mdash;deserted,
cool, and silent as when Hagar had quitted it earlier
in the morning. Built high above the ground, about the vast
trunk of a vast silk-cotton tree was a square, railed platform
reached by a flight of steps. A bench ran around it; it was a
cool and airy perch, chequered with shadows of leaf and twig
and with a sight of the azure sea. The two mounted the steps,
and moving around the trunk to a well-shaded angle, sat
down. No one at all seemed near; for solitude it was much
like a tree house which, shipwrecked, they might have built
on a desert island.</p>

<p>"Life's the most curious thing!" said Gayde.</p>

<p>"Isn't it? 'Curiouser and curiouser!' said Alice. I was
twelve years old that summer we shared the apple turnovers."</p>

<p>"We didn't share them. You gave me all.&mdash;I was nineteen."</p>

<p>"And then&mdash;how many years?&mdash;Nine, isn't it?&mdash;that
night at that Socialist meeting, when you spoke&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"What were you doing there? I asked about you&mdash;I got
to know well many of the people who were there that night&mdash;but
no one could identify you. And though I kept you in
mind, and looked for you, too, I could never find you again."</p>

<p>"I was spending the winter in New York. That night we
had missed the theatre. We walked down Fourth Avenue
and across&mdash;we were seeing New York at night. A crowd
was going into that hall, and we went in too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"Not until I got home that night did I remember that I
did not know your name.... And in a month I was upon the
ocean, and I have been in America very little in all the years
since. I am here this winter with my father.... And you?"</p>

<p>She regarded him with dark eyes, simple and serious and
interested as the eyes with which as a child she had regarded
him above her flower dolls. He was not hungry and haggard
and fear-ridden as then, nor was he as he had been the night
of the Socialist meeting, somewhat embarrassed and stumbling,
strong, but piteous, too.... He was a little thin and worn,
and looked as though he had been ill, she noted, but he was
quiet, at ease, and assured. There needed no elaborate process
in telling her things; to intuition she added a considerable
knowledge of the world and of ways and means; to heart,
intellect. One could do much in nine years; she knew that
from personal experience. This man had added to native
strength education, experience, poise, and significance. She
might have said culture, only she had grown to dislike the
word. He had not, evidently, attained to wealth as wealth
is counted. In a region where the male visitor, though he
might arrive in winter garments, promptly sloughed them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
off for fine white flannels, he had not followed custom. It was
true that he was not wearing a winter suit, but what was
probably a last summer's one. It was not white&mdash;only a
grey, light-weight business suit, ready-made and somewhat
worn. His straw hat looked new. He was clean-shaven. His
face was at once the face of the boy in the thicket, and the
face of the workman talking out of bitter experience to other
workmen, and a new face, too,&mdash;a judging face, ascetic
rather than not, with eyes that carried a passion for something
vaster than the flesh. "And you?" asked Hagar again.</p>

<p>But he had fallen into a brown study. "<i>Hagar Ashendyne</i>&mdash;You
can't be&mdash;do you mean that you are&mdash;Hagar Ashendyne,
the writer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Hagar Ashendyne, the writer." She smiled. "It
never occurred to me that you might read what I have written.
Have you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have read what you have written&mdash;read it and
cared for it greatly.... Well, all life's a strange encounter!"</p>

<p>"And that's true enough. And now will you tell me about
yourself?"</p>

<p>His eyes smiled back at her. "Let me see&mdash;what is there
to tell? That night in New York.... Well, after that night ... I
was fortunate in the work I got, and I rose from grade
to grade. I studied hard, every moment I could get. I read
and read and read. I became secretary to a certain Socialist
organization. I have been for some years a Socialist organizer,
lecturer, and occasional writer. In the summer I am to
take the editorship of a Socialist paper. Behold the short and
simple annals of the poor!"</p>

<p>"How long are you going to be in Nassau?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"A whole month. These last two years have been years of
exacting, constant work, and there's a prospect of the same
continuing. I thought I'd got my second wind&mdash;and then I
came down suddenly. The doctor said that if I wanted to do
the paper justice&mdash;and I do&mdash;I'd have to give it an editor
who could sleep. So he and Rose packed me off."</p>

<p>"Rose?"</p>

<p>"My wife&mdash;Rose Darragh."</p>

<p>He spoke as though she would know the name. Indeed, it
seemed to have for her some association; but it wavered like
a dream; she could not fix it. She seemed to feel how long
she had been away from America&mdash;out of touch&mdash;not
knowing things, events, trendings. "Nine years," she said
again, uncertainly; "so much happens in nine years."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Personal life changes rapidly to-day&mdash;with
everything more flexible, with horizons growing wider&mdash;and
the age follows and changes and changes&mdash;changes
and mounts. We are in for a great century. I'm glad to be
alive!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am, too." Presently she looked at her watch. It
was luncheon-time. Would he not take it with her father and
herself? No; he would not do that to-day; but leaving the
great tree and the garden they walked together to the house.
At the gate in the wall she said, "Come to see me here to-morrow
morning, if you will. I should like you to come and
go as you please."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, then, with emphasis, "<i>friend</i>....
That is what, when I was nineteen and afterwards, I called
you in my mind."</p>

<p>"It's a good word&mdash;'friend.' Let us use it still."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"With all the will in the world. You are wonderful to me&mdash;Hagar
Ashendyne."</p>

<p>"I am glad to have found you again, Denny Gayde."</p>

<p>That night, suddenly, before she slept, she placed the
name Rose Darragh.... A feminist&mdash;A Socialist agitator
and leader&mdash;a writer of vigorous prose&mdash;sociology&mdash;economics.... She
seemed to see her picture in some magazine of
current life&mdash;a face rich, alert, and daring, rising on a strong
throat from a blouse like a peasant's.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />

HAGAR AND DENNY</h2>


<p>The afternoon sun yet made a dazzle of the white road. Infrequent
trees cast infrequent shadows. It was warm, but
not too warm, with an endless low wind. The tide was going
out; there spread an expanse of iridescent shallows, and beyond
a line of water so blue that it was unearthly. There was
a tonic smell of salt and marsh. The wheels of the surrey,
the horse's hoofs, brought a pleasant, monotonous, rhythmic
sense of sound and motion.</p>

<p>"That is the shell house," said Hagar, breaking a long
silence; "that small, small house with the boat behind. There
you can buy throngs of things that come out of the sea&mdash;coral
and sponges and purple sea-fans and wonderful shells."</p>

<p>"I walked out here last week. There's a sick child I know&mdash;a
little cripple. I am going to take her a great box of the
prettiest shells. She'll lie there and play with them in her
dingy corner of the dingy room where all the others work,
and maybe they'll bring her a little of all this.... God
knows!"</p>

<p>The wheels went on. They passed the small house with a
great lump of coral on one side of the door, and a tall purple
sea-fan upon the other.</p>

<p>"I sometimes think," said Hagar, "that the trouble with
me is that I am too general. My own sharp inner struggle
was for intellectual and spiritual freedom. I had to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
away from concepts with which the atmosphere in which I
was raised was saturated. I had to think away from creeds
and dogmas and affirmations made for me by my ancestors. I
had to think away from the idea of a sacrosanct Past and the
virtue of Immobility;&mdash;not the true idea of the mighty Past
as our present body which we are to lift and ennoble, and not
Immobility as the supreme refusal to be diverted from that
purpose,&mdash;but the Past, that is made up of steps forward,
set and stubborn against another step, and Immobility blind
to any virtue in Change. I had to think away from a concept
of woman that the future can surely only sadly laugh at.
I had to think away from Sanctions and Authorities and Taboos
and Divine Rights&mdash;and when I had done so, I had to
go back with the lamp of wider knowledge, deeper feeling,
and find how organic and on the whole virtuous in its day
was each husk and shell. The trouble was that in love with
the lesser we would keep out the stronger day ... and there
was everywhere a sickness of conflict. I had to think away
from my own dogmatisms and intolerances. I'm still engaged
in doing that.... What has come of it all is a certain universal
feeling.... I'm not explaining very well what I mean, but&mdash;though
I want to be able to do it&mdash;it is difficult for me to
drive the lightning in a narrow track to a definite end. It's
playing over everything."</p>

<p>"I see what you mean. You're more the philosopher than
the crusader. Well, we need philosophers, too!... I'm more,
I think, the type that is sharpened to a point, that couches
its lance for one Promised Land, which it believes is the key
to many another. But I hold that it is better to move full-orbed,
if you can."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not know&mdash;I do not know," said Hagar. "I try to
plunge with my whole mind into some political or social
theory, but I fail. Even the slow drawing-up of the submerged
capacities in woman, even the helping in that,&mdash;which
is greater than would be the discovery of Atlantis, which is
greater than almost anything else,&mdash;cannot bring the ends
together. Name everything and there is so much besides!"</p>

<p>"There is such a thing," said Denny, "as going to the
stake for what you know to be partial, only factors, scaffoldings,
stairs to mount by.... Stairs and scaffoldings are necessary;
therefore, die for them if need be."</p>

<p>"I agree there," answered Hagar.</p>

<p>The surrey had left the sight of the sea. The pale road
stretched straight before them, going on until it touched the
cobalt sky. On either hand stood growing walls, dense and
thorny as those about the Sleeping Beauty's palace&mdash;all
manner of trees, silver palm and thatch palm, tamarind,
poison-wood and plum, ink-berry and jack-bush, bound all
together with smilax and many another vine. At long intervals
occurred an opening, a ragged space and a hut or cabin,
with an odour, too languid-sweet, of orange blossoms, and a
vision of black children. The walls closed in again sombrely.
The road would have been a little dreary but for the sky and
the sun and the jewel-fine air.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Hagar, "that there is a certain Brahmin-like
attitude to be overcome. I suppose that to take wallet
and staff and go with the mass upon the day's march, encouraging,
lifting, helping, pointing forward, bearing with the
others, is a nobler thing than to run ahead upon your own
path and cry back to the throng, 'Why are you not here as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
well?' I suppose that ... and yet there are times when I am
Nietzschean, too. I can be opposites."</p>

<p>"Yes; that is what bewilders," said Denny. "To include
contradictories and irreconcilables&mdash;to be both centripetal
and centrifugal&mdash;to be in one brain Socialist and Individualist!... But
the greatest among mankind have found themselves
able. They have been farthest ahead, and yet they
have always seemed to be in the midst."</p>

<p>The sun sank low, the white road grew pallid. "Better
turn presently," said Hagar.</p>

<p>"When we get to that palm. How wonderful it stands
against the sky!&mdash;I never thought that I should see palm
trees."</p>

<p>When they came to it, the negro driver turned the horse.
Roll of wheel and slow thud of hoofs they went dreamily
back toward Nassau. The walls on either hand were darkening;
the sky was putting on a splendid dress.</p>

<p>"Years and years now I have been away," said Hagar. "In
the spring I am going home."</p>

<p>"Home to&mdash;to Gilead Balm?"</p>

<p>"At first, yes, I think ... then, I do not know. I have
been away so long. There are people in New York I want to
see&mdash;old friends&mdash;women. Do you chance to know Elizabeth
Eden?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know her. She's one of the blessed." After a
moment he said abruptly, "I want you to know Rose
Darragh."</p>

<p>"Yes, I want to," said Hagar simply.</p>

<p>They came before long to the shell house. "Let us stop
and get some shells."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Inside they had the place, save for the merchant of shells,
to themselves. Right and left and all around were strewn the
pearl and pink and purply spoils. All the sunset tints were
here, and the beauty of delicate form&mdash;grotesqueries, too;
nature in queer moods. It was pleasant to run the hands
through the myriad small shells heaped in baskets, to weigh
the sea-cushions and sea-stars and golden seafeathers, to
admire rose coral and brain coral and finger coral, and hold
the conch shells to the ear. Through the open door, too,
came the smell and murmur of the near-by sea, and on the
floor lay one last splash of sunlight. "Give me a shell," said
Hagar, "and I will give you one. Then each of us will have
something to remember the other by."</p>

<p>They gravely picked them out, and it took some minutes
to do it. Then in turn each crossed to the merchant in his
corner and paid the purchase price, then came back to the
light in the doorway.</p>

<p>Denny held out a delicate, translucent, rosy shell. "It
won't hold my gratitude," he said. "You'll never know.... I
used to see you in the moonlight, between me and the bars.... Somebody
had cried for me, ... wept passionately. It
helped to keep me human. I've always seen you with a light
about you. This is your shell."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I shall keep your kind gift always," said
Hagar. She spoke in a child's lyric voice, quaintly and properly,
so precisely as she might have spoken at twelve years
old that, startled herself, she laughed, and Denny, with a
catch in his voice, laughed too. "Oh," she cried with something
like a sob, "sixteen years to slip from one like that!"
She held out a small purple shell. "This is yours, Denny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Gayde.... And I've thought of you often, and wished you
well. If I did you, unknowing, a service, so you, unknowing,
have done me a service, too. That summer morning, long
ago&mdash;it shocked me awake. The world since then has been
different always, more pitiful and nearer. Here's your shell.
It won't hold my gratitude and well-wishing either."</p>

<p>They passed out between the coral and the sea-fans,
entered the surrey, and it drove on. Now they were back by
the sea. The tide was far out, the expanse of shallows vaster.
The salt pools had been fired by the torch of the sky; they lay
in reds and purples, wonderful. The smell of the sea impregnated
the air and there blew a whispering wind. The town
began to appear, straggling out to meet them, low chimneyless
houses of the poorer sort. Men and women were out in
the twilight, and children calling to one another and playing.
The vivid lights had faded from sky and from wet sand and
rock, shoal and lagoon, but colour was left, though it was the
ghost of itself. It swam in the air, it gleamed from the earth.
Warmth was there, too, and languor, and the melancholy of
the gathering night. A dreamlike quality came into things&mdash;the
children's voices sounded faint and far; only there were
waves of some faint odour, coming now it seemed from gardens.... Now
they were in the town and the sea was shut
away.</p>

<p>"One half of my fairy month is gone."</p>

<p>"You are sleeping better?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;much better.... Where shall we go to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Leave it to to-morrow. Look at the star ... oh, beauty!"</p>

<p>When to-morrow was here they walked inland to Fort Fincastle,
and then to the Queen's Staircase. Negro children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
raced after them with some sweet-smelling yellow flower in
their hands. "Penny, Boss!&mdash;Penny, Boss!&mdash;Penny, Boss!"
When they were gone, and when two surreys filled with
white-dressed hotel people vanished likewise, they had the
Queen's Staircase to themselves. Broad-stepped, cut in the
living rock, it plunged downward to the green bottom of the
seventy-foot deep ancient quarry. Trees overhung it and
yellow flowers, and there was a rich, green light like the bottom
of the sea. Denny and Hagar sat upon a step a quarter
of the way down.</p>

<p>"I do not know why," said Denny, "there should be so
deadly a fear of upheaval. All growth comes with upheaval&mdash;surely
all spiritual growth comes so. Growth by accretion
means little. Growth from within comes with upheaval&mdash;what
you have been transformed or discarded. A little higher, a little
finer breaks the sod and grows forth so. The deadly fear
should be of down-sinking&mdash;from the stagnant grow-no-farther-than-our-fathers-grew
down&mdash;down.... Of course,
the Woman Movement means upheaval and great upheaval&mdash;but
that is a poor reason for condemnation.... As far as
its political aspect is concerned, most open-minded men, Socialists
and others, with whom I come into contact, admit
the right and the need. Unless a man is very stupid he can
see what a farce it is to talk of a democracy&mdash;government
of the people, for the people, by the people&mdash;when one out
of every two human beings is notoriously living under an
aristocracy. And, of course, we who want an associative
gain of livelihood, no less than an associative form of government,
stand for her equality there.... But to me there
is something other than all that in this upheaval. I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
express it. I do not know what it is, unless it is some faint,
supernal promise.... It is as though the Spirit were again
working upon the face of the waters." He paused, gazing
upward at the sky above the wall of rock. "We are in for a
deep change."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. A lift of mind and a change of heart, on
which to base a chance for a deep change, indeed. A richer,
deeper life.... Oh, there will be dross enough for a time,
tares, detritus, heat and dust and wounds of conflict, Babel,
cries and counter-cries! and some will think they lose...."</p>

<p>"They'll only think so for a while. Nothing can be lost."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;only transmuted.... But I hate the tumult and
the shouting while the people are yet bewildered. If that's
the Brahmin in me, I am going to sacrifice him. I am going
where the battle is."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt that."</p>

<p>More white-suited people appeared, at their heels the
black children. "Penny, Boss!&mdash;Penny, Boss!&mdash;Penny,
Boss!" Hagar and Denny rose and walked back to town
through the warm, fragrant ways. He left her at Greer's studio&mdash;she
had promised to come look at the portrait. As they
stood a moment in the verandah, Medway's golden drawl was
heard from within. "Well, I've known a good many philosophers&mdash;but
none that were irreducible. Every heroic, every
transcendental treads at last the same pavement. 'I love
and seek the street called pleasure. I abhor and avoid the
street called pain.' Therefore the <i>summum bonum</i>&mdash;" The
door opened to Hagar. She smiled and waved her hand, and
the studio swallowed her up.</p>

<p>Some days after this they drove one afternoon over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Blue Hills to the southern beach. Long white road&mdash;long
white road&mdash;and on either hand pine and scrub, pine and
scrub, and over all a vault of sky achingly blue. It was a
lonely road, a road untravelled to-day, and the wind shook
in the palmetto scrub. Small grey birds flitted before them,
or cheeped from the tangled wood. It was a day for silence and
they stayed silent so long that the negro driving, who was
afraid of silence, broke it himself. He told them about things,
and when they awoke and genially answered, he was happy
and talked on to himself until they, too, were talking, when
he lapsed into silence and contentment. The wind blew, the
scrub rustled, the sky was sapphire&mdash;oh, sapphire!</p>

<p>When they came after a good while to the South Beach,
they left the surrey and the horse and the driver, in the
shade of the trees that fringed the beach, and walked slowly
a long way, over the firm sand. It stretched, a silver shore;
the sun was westering, the great sea making a hoarse, profound
murmur. They walked in silence, thinking their own
thoughts. Before them, half-sunken in the sand, lay an
old boat. When they came to it, they sat down upon its
shattered, sun-dried boards, with the sand at their feet and
the grave evening light stealing up and Mother Ocean speaking,
speaking....</p>

<p>"In the last analysis it is," said Hagar, "a metaphysical
adventure&mdash;a love-quest if you will. There is a passion of
the mind, there is the questing soul, there is the desire that
will have union with nothing less than the whole. I will think
freely, and largely, and doing that, under pain of being false,
I must act freely and largely, live freely and largely. Nor
must I think one thing and speak another, nor must I be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
silent when silence betrays the whole.... And so woman no
less than man comes into the open."</p>

<p>"There is something that broods in this time," said Denny.
"I do not know what it will hatch. But something vaster,
something nobler...."</p>

<p>Hagar let the warm sand stream through her fingers. "Oh,
how blue is the sea.... Æons and æons and æons ago, when
slowly, slowly life drew itself forth from such a sea as this
into upper air&mdash;when Amphibian began to know two elements,
how much richer was life for Amphibian, how great
was the gain!... When, after æons and æons, there was all
manner of warm-blooded life in woods like these behind us,
or in richer woods ... and one day, dimly, dimly, some primate
thought, and her children and grandchildren a little,
little more consciously thought, and it spread.... To that
tribe how strange a dawn! 'We are growing away from the
four-footed&mdash;we are growing away from our sister the gibbon
and our brother the chimpanzee&mdash;we are growing&mdash;we
are changing&mdash;we feel the heavens over us and a strange
new life within us&mdash;we are passing out, we are coming in&mdash;we
need a new word....' And at last they called themselves
<i>human</i>&mdash;æons ago...."</p>

<p>"And now?"</p>

<p>"And now, on the human plane, it seems to me that we
may be immediately above that region." She took a pointed
piece of driftwood and drew upon the sand. "Here is the
human plane&mdash;and here above it is another plane." She
drew a diagonal line between. "And that is a stairway of
growth from one to the other. And we are turning from this
plane&mdash;the lower plane&mdash;and coming upon that stairway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
and down it, to meet us, pours like a morning wind, like the
first light in the sky, a hint of what may be. Like that ancestral
tribe, we are growing, we are changing&mdash;we feel a
strange new life within us&mdash;we are passing out, we are coming
in&mdash;we need a new word."</p>

<p>"What would it be?"</p>

<p>"I do not know.... After a while, an age hence maybe,
when the light is stronger, we will coin it. Now there is only
intuition of the change.... There is something in a translation
I was reading of one of the Upanishads, 'But he who discerns
all creatures in his Self and his Self in all creatures, has
no disquiet.... What delusion, what grief can be with him
in whom all creatures have become the very self of the
thinker, discerning their oneness?... He has spread around
a thing, bright, bodiless, taking no hurt, sinewless, pure, unsmitten
by evil.... That might come after a long, long
time, after change upon change."</p>

<p>The great sea murmured on, a wild white bird flew across
the round of vision, melted into the sunset.</p>

<p>"And each change is greater by geometrical progression
than was the one before?"</p>

<p>"Not the change itself, but that into which the change
leads us. Each time we depart at right angles.... Yes, I
think so."</p>

<p>"And the movement of women toward freedom of field and
toward self-recognition&mdash;no less than the general movement
toward socialization&mdash;is part of the change?"</p>

<p>"All things are part of it.... Yes, it is part."</p>

<p>She rose from the sand. "The sun is setting." They
walked back to the surrey and took the homeward road. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
they came over the Blue Hills it was first dusk; the town lay,
grey-pearl, before them, and above it swam the moon, full
and opaline. "How many days have you now?"</p>

<p>"Just seven."</p>

<p>"Have you heard from Rose Darragh?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She's been doing her work and mine, too. She begs
me to stay another two weeks, but I must not. There is no
need&mdash;I am perfectly well again&mdash;it would only be selfish
enjoyment."</p>

<p>"I wish it were possible&mdash;but if it's not, it's not.... Oh,
how large the moon is! You can almost see it a globe&mdash;it is
like a beautiful, lighted Japanese lantern."</p>

<p>"Where will we go to-morrow afternoon?"</p>

<p>"We cannot go anywhere to-morrow afternoon, for, alas!
I have to go to a garden-party at Government House. But
the next day we might go to Old Fort. What is that fragrance&mdash;those
strange lilies? Look now at the Japanese lantern!"</p>

<p>They went to Old Fort and came back in the warm evening
light, driving close to the sounding sea. "Five days now,"
said Denny. "Well, I have been so happy."</p>

<p>That night Hagar could not sleep. She rose at last from
the bed and paced her moon-flooded room. All the long
windows were wide; the night air came in and brought a
sighing of the trees. After a while she stepped out upon the
gallery that ran along the face of the house. Medway's room
was down stairs and away from this front; she had the long
silvered pathway to herself. She paced it slowly, up and
down, wooing calm. Each time she reached the end of the
gallery, she paused a moment and looked across the sleeping
town that lay for the most part below this house and garden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
to where she could guess the roof of the small, inexpensive,
half hotel, half boarding-house where Denny bided. When
after a time she discovered that she was doing this, she shook
herself away from the action. "No, Hagar, no!"</p>

<p>Going to the other end of the gallery, she found there a
low chair and sat down, leaning her head against the railing.
It was the middle of the night. Something in the place and
in the balm of the air brought back to her those days and
nights in Alexandria, so long ago. There, too, she had had to
make choice.... "I could love him here and now&mdash;love
him&mdash;love him in the old immemorial way.... Well, I will
not!" She put her elbows on her knees, her chin in her hands.
"<i>Rose Darragh&mdash;Rose Darragh&mdash;Rose Darragh</i>"&mdash;it
struck through her mind, slow and heavily vibrant, like a
deep and melancholy music. She rose and paced the gallery
again, but when she came to the farther end, she turned
without pause or look over the moonlit town.</p>

<p>"<i>Rose Darragh&mdash;Rose Darragh</i>"&mdash;she made it rhythmic,
breathing deeply and quietly, saying the name inwardly,
deeply, but without passion now, saying it like a comrade's
name. "<i>Rose Darragh&mdash;Rose Darragh&mdash;Rose Darragh&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>Calm came at last, repose of mind, victory. She sat down
again, leaned her arms upon the railing, and followed with
her eyes the lonely, silver moon. Work was in the world, the
all-friend Work; and Beauty was in the world, the all-friend
Beauty; and one good put out of reach, mind and spirit must
make another and were equal to the task. "Rose Darragh&mdash;Rose
Darragh!&mdash;not if I could would I hurt you," said
Hagar; and took her attention from that matter and put it
first upon the stars, and then upon some lines of Shelley's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
that she loved, and then upon the story she had in hand. It
was not well to go to bed thinking of a story, and when at
last she left the gallery and laid herself straight upon the
cool linen, she stilled the waves of the mind-stuff and let the
barque of attention drift whither it would. At last she
seemed in a deep forest long ago and far away, and there she
went to sleep with a feeling of violets under her hand.</p>

<p>Five days, and Denny left Nassau. "It's not saying good-bye.
In May, when you come to New York&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, in May I'll see you and Rose Darragh. Until May,
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Denny and she clasped hands, both hands. "Thank God
for friends!" he said with the odd little laugh that she liked,
with the catch in the voice at the end of it as though he had
started to laugh and then Life had come in. His eyes were
misty. He brushed his hand across them. "You are dancing
before me," he said apologetically.</p>

<p>She laughed herself. "And you are dancing before me!
Good-bye, good-bye, Denny Gayde! Let's be friends always."</p>

<p>From the garden she watched the Miami steam slowly
down the narrow harbour, and, passing the lighthouse, turn
to the open sea. She watched it until it was but a black
speck with a dark feather of smoke, and then until the feather
and all had melted into the sky. "Well," she said, "there's
work and beauty and high cheer, and Time that smooths
away most violences!"</p>

<p>But she did not see Denny and Rose Darragh in May. That
evening at dinner Medway was more than usually good company.
He had a high colour; his hair and curling beard had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
been cut just the length that was most becoming; he looked
superbly handsome. Often he affected Hagar as would a very
fine canvas, some portrait by Titian. To-night was one of
these nights.</p>

<p>Greer dined with them, and he was urging Medway as he
had urged before to let him paint him. "Fortune's smiling
on us both&mdash;on you as well as me. Neither of us may have
such a chance again! Let me&mdash;ah, let me!"</p>

<p>"What should I do with it when it was done, and if I liked
it&mdash;which you know, Greer, is not dead certain? You can't
hang portraits in a nomad's tent, and I haven't a soul in the
world to give it to,&mdash;my mother would like a coloured
photograph of me, but she wouldn't like Greer's picture,&mdash;unless
Gipsy will take it when she sets up her own establishment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will take it with thanks," said Hagar. "Let Mr. Greer
do it."</p>

<p>Medway said he would consider it. Dinner went off gaily
with stories and badinage. Afterwards the traveller from
the Colonial came in, and then the violinist. He played for
them&mdash;played rhapsodies and fantasias. It was after eleven
when the three guests departed. Greer's gay voice could be
heard down the street&mdash;</p>

<p>Thomson appeared, with Mahomet behind him to put out
the lights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-night&mdash;sleep right!" said Medway. "Pleasant
fellows, aren't they?"</p>

<p>Toward daylight she was awakened by a knock at her door,
followed by Thomson's voice. "Mr. Ashendyne has had
some kind of a stroke, Miss Hagar&mdash;" She sprang up,
threw on a kimono, opened the door, and ran downstairs
with Thomson. "I heard him breathing heavily&mdash;I've
waked Mahomet and sent the black boy for the doctor&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was paralysis. And after months of Nassau, she took
him back to the mainland and northward by slow stages,
not to Gilead Balm, for he made always "No!" with his head
and eyes to that, and not to New York for he seemed impatient
of that, too; but at last to Washington. There she
and Thomson found a pleasant residence to let on a tree-embowered
avenue, and there they moved him, and there
she stayed with him two years and read a vast number of
books aloud, and between the readings cultivated a sunny
talkativeness. At the end of the two years there came a
second stroke which killed him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

GILEAD BALM</h2>


<p>"It's a foolish piece of idealism," said Ralph. "But she's had
her way so long I suppose it's impossible now to check her."</p>

<p>The Colonel's irritation exploded. White-haired, hawk-nosed
and eyed, a little stooped now, a good deal shrunken
in his black, old-fashioned, aristocratic clothes, he lifted a
bloodless hand and made emphasis with a long forefinger.
"Precisely so! One world mistake lay in ever giving property
unqualifiedly into a woman's hands, and another in ever encouraging
occupations outside the household, and so breeding
this independent attitude&mdash;an attitude which I for one
find the most intolerable feature of this intolerable latter age!
I opposed the Married Woman's Property Act in this state,
but the people were infatuated and passed it. Married or
single, the principle is the same. It is folly to give woman
control of any considerable sum of money&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. LeGrand, entering the Gilead Balm library, caught
the last three sentences. She smiled on the two gentlemen
and took her seat upon the sofa. "Money and women are
you talking about? Where money comes in," said Mrs.
LeGrand, "I always act under advice. Women know very
little about finance, and their judgment is rarely to be
trusted."</p>

<p>"Just so, my dear friend! It is not in the least," spoke the
Colonel, "that I am acquisitive or that it will make any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
great difference to me personally if Medway's wealth stays
in the family or no. What I am commenting upon is the
folly of giving a woman power to do so foolish a thing."</p>

<p>"Hagar always <i>could</i> do foolish things," said Miss Serena,
looking up from her Mexican drawnwork.</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand yet," said Mrs. LeGrand.
"Mrs. Ashendyne was telling me in the big room yesterday
evening, and then some one came in&mdash;dear Medway's will
left her without proviso all that he had&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As was quite proper," said Ralph, "the Colonel to the
contrary. Well, the principal comes to considerably over a
million dollars&mdash;the cool million his second wife left him by
her will and the settlement she had already made upon their
marriage. The investment is gilt-edged. Altogether it
would make Hagar not an extremely rich woman as riches
are counted nowadays, but&mdash;yes, certainly for the South&mdash;a
very rich woman. But now comes in your feminine tender
conscience&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hagar refuses to put on black," said Miss Serena. "I
don't see that she's got a tender conscience&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The entire amount&mdash;everything that came from the
fortune&mdash;she turns back to the fund which the second wife
established for workingmen's housing. She states that she
agrees with her stepmother's views as to how the fortune
was made, and that she does not care to be a beneficiary.
She says that her stepmother had evidently given thought to
the matter and preferred that form of 'restitution' and that
her only duty is simply to return this million and more to
the fund already erected, and from which it was diverted for
Cousin Medway's benefit."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>"Duty!" exclaimed Mrs. LeGrand. "I don't see where
'duty' comes in. Her 'duty' is to see that her father was
wise for her. If he was content there's surely no reason why
she should not be so!"</p>

<p>"Hagar," said Miss Serena, "never could see proper distinctions
between people. I don't see that working-people
are housed so badly&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ralph laughed mirthlessly. "Yes, they are, Cousin Serena!
Scarcely any of them have tiled bathrooms and the best type
of porcelain-lined tub, and very few have libraries that'll
accommodate more than a thousand volumes, and quite a
number do without nurseries papered with scenes from
Mother Goose. And as they're all for that kind of housing,
they're preparing to move in&mdash;just a little preliminary ousting
of a few people with more brains and money and in they
go!&mdash;cuckoos laying their eggs in abler folks' nests! This
is the age of the cuckoo."</p>

<p>"How absurd," said Miss Serena, "Gilead Balm hasn't
a tiled bathroom, nor an extremely large library, and when
I was a child the nursery wasn't papered at all. But we are
perfectly comfortable at Gilead Balm. It's a heinous sin&mdash;discontent
with your lot in life."</p>

<p>"Do you mean," asked Mrs. LeGrand, "that, against your
counsel and advice, Hagar is really going headstrongly on
to do this silly thing?"</p>

<p>"Apparently so. She is," said the Colonel, "of age. There
again was a mistake&mdash;to let women come of age. Perpetual
minors&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. LeGrand laughed. "Colonel, you are not very gallant!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The Colonel turned to her. "Oh, my dear friend, you're
not the modern, unwomanly type that professes to see something
degrading in the subordination that God and Nature
have decreed for woman! Gallant! That's just what I am.
Knights and gallantry were for the type that's vanishing,
though"&mdash;he bowed to Mrs. LeGrand, who had not a little
of her old beauty left&mdash;"though here and there is left a
shining example!"</p>

<p>Mrs. LeGrand used her fan. "Oh, Colonel, there are many
of us who like the old ways best."</p>

<p>Ralph drummed with his fingers upon the table. "To
come back to Hagar&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hagar herself entered the room.</p>

<p>She was dressed in white; she was a little thin and pale,
for the last weeks had been trying ones. Habitually she had
a glancing way of ranging from an appearance of youth almost
girlish to a noble look of young maturity. To-day she
looked her thirty-one years, but looked them regally.</p>

<p>Once the Colonel would not have hesitated to hector her,
Miss Serena peevishly to blame what she could not understand,
Mrs. LeGrand to attempt smoothly to put her down.
All that seemed impossible now. There was about her the
glamour of successful work, of a known person. Mrs. LeGrand
had recently purchased a "Who's Who," and had
found her there. <i>Ashendyne, Hagar, author; b. Gilead Balm,
in Virginia</i>, and so on. From various chronicles of the realm
of contemporary literature she had gathered that Hagar's
name would be found in yet more exclusive lists than "Who's
Who." Of course, all in the room had read much of what she
had written, and equally, of course, each of the four had, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
temperamental reasons, spokenly or unspokenly depreciated
it. But all knew that she had&mdash;though they could not see
the justice of her having&mdash;that standing in the world. Mrs.
LeGrand always, with patrons, smoothly brought it in that
she had been a pupil at Eglantine. None of them knew how
much she made by her writing; it was to be supposed it was
something, seeing that she was coolly throwing away a million
dollars. There was likewise the glamour of much absence
in foreign lands; the undefined feeling that here were
novelties of experience and adventure, ground with which she
was familiar and they were not. Of experience and adventure
in psychical lands they took no account. But it was undeniable
that her knowing Europe and Asia and Africa added
to the already considerable difficulty in properly expressing
to Hagar how criminally foolish she was being. Added to
that, there was something in herself that prevented it.</p>

<p>Ralph spoke first. "We were talking, Hagar, about your
idea of what to do with Cousin Medway's money. Here are
only kinspeople and old friends, and we all wish that you
wouldn't do it, and think that there'll come a day when
you'll be sorry&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Colonel, leaning back in his chair, stroked his white
imperial. "I should never have said, Gipsy, that you were
the sentimental, beggar-tending kind&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hagar's kindly eyes that had travelled from her cousin to
her grandfather, now went on to Mrs. LeGrand. "And you?"
they seemed to say.</p>

<p>"Why couldn't you," said Mrs. LeGrand, "do both?
Why couldn't you give a handsome donation&mdash;give a really
large amount to this charity? And then why not feel that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
you had, so to speak, the rest in trust, and give liberally, so
much a year, to all kinds of worthy enterprises? I don't believe
the most benevolent heart could find anything to complain
of in that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hagar's eyes went to Miss Serena.</p>

<p>"You ought to take advice," said Miss Serena. "How can
you know that your judgment is good?"</p>

<p>Hagar gave her eyes to all in company. "It is right that
you should say what you think. We are all too bound together
for one not to be ready to listen and give weight to
what the others think. But having done it, our own judgment
has to determine at last, hasn't it? It seems to me that
it is right to do what I am doing&mdash;what I have done, for it
is practically accomplished. I saw all necessary lawyers and
people last week in New York. Of course, I hope that you'll
come to see it as I do, but if you do not, still I'll hope that
you'll believe that I am right in doing what I hold to be
right. And now don't let's talk of that any more."</p>

<p>"What I want to know," said Miss Serena, "is how you're
going to live, if you don't take your dead father's support&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hagar looked at her in surprise. "Live? Why, live as I
have lived for years&mdash;upon what I earn."</p>

<p>"I didn't suppose you could do that.&mdash;What <i>do</i> you
earn?"</p>

<p>"It depends. Some years more, some years less. I have
published a good deal and there is a continuing sale. England
and America together, I am good for something more
than ten thousand a year."</p>

<p>Miss Serena stared at her. A film seemed to come over her
eyes, the muscles of her face slightly worked. "Somewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
about thirty years ago," she said painfully, "I thought I'd
write a book. I'd thought of a pretty story. I wrote to a
printing and publishing company in Richmond about it,
but they wrote back that I'd have to <i>pay</i> to have it
printed."</p>

<p>That night in her bedroom, plethoric with small products
of needle, crochet-needle, and paint-box, Miss Serena drew
down the shades of all four windows preparatory to undressing.
She was upstairs, there was a thick screen of cedars and
no house or hill or person who could possibly command her
windows, but she would have been horribly uneasy with undrawn
shades. Ready for bed, she always blew out the lamp
before she again bared the windows.</p>

<p>Some one knocked at the door. "Who is it?" called Miss
Serena, her hand upon her dress-waist.</p>

<p>"It's Hagar. May I come in?"</p>

<p>It seemed that Hagar just wanted to talk. And she talked,
with charm, of twenty things. Mostly of happenings about
the old place. She asked about the latest panel of garden
lilies and cat-tails, and she took the wonderfully embroidered
pincushion from the bureau and admired it. "I think that
I'm going to have an apartment in New York this winter,
and if I do, won't you make me a pincushion? And, Aunt
Serena, you must come sometimes to see me."</p>

<p>"You'll be marrying. You ought to marry Ralph."</p>

<p>"Even so, you could come to see me, couldn't you? But I
am not going to marry Ralph."</p>

<p>Miss Serena stiffened. "The whole family wants you to&mdash;" She
was upon family authority, and the wooing had to be
done all over again....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw Thomasine in New York. She's going to live with
me as my secretary. You know that she has been a typewriter
and stenographer for a long time, and they say she
is an excellent one. She has been studying, too, other things
at night, after her long hours. She is as pretty and sweet
as ever. When you come, the three of us will do wonderful
things together&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Serena's bosom swelled. "I wonder when Ashendynes
and Dales and Greens began to 'do things'&mdash;by which
I suppose you mean going to theatres and concerts and
stores and such things&mdash;together! The bottom rail's on
top with a vengeance in these days! But your mother before
you had no sense of blood."</p>

<p>Hagar sat silent, with a feeling of despair. Then she began
again, her subject the flower garden, and then, at last&mdash;"Aunt
Serena, tell me about the story <i>you</i> wanted to
write...."</p>

<p>Ralph&mdash;Ralph was too insistent, she thought. He found
her the next morning, under the old sycamore by the river,
and he proceeded again to be insistent.</p>

<p>She stopped him impatiently. "Ralph, do you wish still
to be friends, or do you wish me to put you one side of the
Equator and myself on the other? I can do it."</p>

<p>"The Equator's an imaginary line."</p>

<p>"You'll find that an imaginary line can change you into
a stranger."</p>

<p>"Hagar, I'm used to getting what I set my heart and brain
upon."</p>

<p>"So was a gentleman named Napoleon Bonaparte. He got
it&mdash;up to a certain limit."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't believe you are in earnest. I don't believe you
have ever really considered&mdash;And I intend one day to make
you see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"See what? See my enormous advantage in marrying you?
Oh, you&mdash;man!"</p>

<p>"See that you love me."</p>

<p>"How, you mean, can I help it? Oh, you&mdash;featherless
biped!"</p>

<p>Ralph broke in two the bit of stick in his hands with a
snapping sound. "I'm mad for you, and I'd like to pay you
out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are more remotely ancestral than almost any man I
know!&mdash;Come, come! let us stop this and talk as cousins
and old playmates. There's Wall Street left, and who is
going to be President, and what are you going to do with
Hawk Nest."</p>

<p>"What I wanted to do with Hawk Nest was to fix it up for
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ralph, Ralph! I should laugh at you, but I feel more
like crying. The pattern is so criss-cross!" She rose from
beneath the sycamore. "I'm going back to the house
now."</p>

<p>He walked beside her. "Do you remember once I told you
I was going to make a great fortune, and you made light of
it? Well, I'm a wealthy man to-day and I shall be a much
wealthier one. It grows now automatically. And that I
would be powerful. Well, I am powerful to-day, and that,
too, grows."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ralph, I wish you well! And if we don't define
wealth and power alike, still your definition is your definition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
And if that's your heart's desire, and I think it is, be happy
in your heart's desire&mdash;until it changes, and then be happier
in the change!"</p>

<p>"I have told you what is my heart's desire."</p>

<p>"I will <i>not</i> go back to that. Look! the sumach is turning
red."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is very pretty.... You didn't see Sylvie Maine&mdash;Sylvie
Carter&mdash;when you were in New York?"</p>

<p>"No. I haven't seen Sylvie since that one first winter
there. I wrote to her when I heard of Jack Carter's death."</p>

<p>"That has been three years ago now. She is a very beautiful
woman and much sought after. I saw a good deal
of her last winter.... Yes, that sumach is getting red.
Autumn's coming.... Hagar! I'm not in the least going to
give up."</p>

<p>"Ralph, I'm going to advise you to use your business
acumen and recognize an unprofitable enterprise when you
see it.... Look at the painted ladies on that thistle!"</p>

<p>"I'm old-fashioned enough to believe that a man can
<i>make</i> a woman love him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you? Be so good as to let me know when you succeed.&mdash;I
warn you that the Equator is getting ready to
drop between."</p>

<p>When they passed the cedars and came to the porch steps,
it was to find Old Miss sitting in the large chair, her white-stockinged
feet firmly planted, her key-basket beside her,
and her knitting-needles glinting.</p>

<p>"Did you have a pleasant walk?" she asked, and looked at
them with a certain massive eagerness.</p>

<p>"Ask Hagar, ma'am. She may have," answered Ralph;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
and took himself into the house. They heard his rather
heavy footfall upon the stair.</p>

<p>Hagar sat down on the porch step. "Ralph has, doubtless,
a great many good qualities, but he is spoiled."</p>

<p>Now Old Miss had a favourite project or projects, and that
was matings between Coltsworths and Ashendynes. Every
few years for perhaps two centuries such matings had occurred.
Many had occurred in her day. With great intensity
she wanted and had wanted for years to see a match made
between her granddaughter and so promising, nay, so accomplishing,
a Coltsworth as Ralph. She was proud of
Ralph&mdash;proud of his appearance, of his ability to get on in
the world and make money and restore Hawk Nest, of his
judgment and knowledge of public affairs which seemed to
her extraordinary. She wanted him to marry Hagar, and
characteristically she refused to admit the possibility of defeat.
But Ralph was no longer quite a young man&mdash;he
ought to have been married years ago. As for Hagar&mdash;Old
Miss loved her granddaughter, but she had very little patience
with her. She was not patient with women generally.
She thought that, on the whole, women were a poor lot&mdash;<i>witness
Maria</i>. Maria lived for Old Miss, lived on one side
in space of her own, core of an atmosphere of smouldering,
dull resentment. If Maria had been different, Medway
would have lived at home. If Maria had known her duty,
there would have been a brood of grandchildren to match
with broods of Coltsworths and others of rank just under the
first. If Maria had been different, this one grandchild
wouldn't be throwing a million dollars away and failing to
love her cousin! If Maria hadn't been a wilful piece, Hagar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
might have escaped being a wilful piece. Old Miss loved her
granddaughter, but that was what she was calling her now in
her mind&mdash;a wilful piece.</p>

<p>Factors that counted with the others at Gilead Balm,
Hagar's very actual detachment and independence, name
and prestige and personality, failed to count with Old Miss.</p>

<p>Such things counted in other cases; they counted in Ralph's
case. But Hagar was of the younger, therefore rightfully
subordinate, generation, and she was female. Ralph was of
the younger generation, also, and as a boy, while Old Miss
spoiled him when he came to Gilead Balm, she expected to
rule him, too. But Ralph had crossed the Rubicon. As soon
as he grew from young boy to man, some mysterious force
placed him without trouble of his own in the conquering superior
class whose dicta must be accepted and whose judgment
must be deferred to. The halo appeared about his head.
He came up equal with and passed ahead of old Miss, elder
generation to the contrary. But Hagar&mdash;Hagar was yet in
the class that was young and couldn't know; she was in the
class of the "poor lot." She was a wilful piece.</p>

<p>"I do not see that Ralph is spoiled," said Old Miss. "He
receives a natural recognition of his ability and success in
life. He is a very successful man, a very able man. He is
giving new weight to the family name. There was a piece in
the paper the other day that said the state ought to be proud
of Ralph. I cut it out," said Old Miss, "and put it in my
scrapbook. I'll show it to you. You ought to read it. I don't
see why you aren't proud of your cousin."</p>

<p>"I hope I may be.&mdash;What are you knitting, grandmother?"</p>

<p>"Any woman might be happy to have Ralph propose to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
her. And any woman but your mother's daughter might
have some care for family happiness and advantage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, grandmother, would my unhappiness in truth advantage
the family?"</p>

<p>"Unhappiness! There's no need for unhappiness. That's
your mother again! Ralph is a splendid man. You ought to
feel flattered. I don't believe in marrying without love, certainly
not without respect; but when you see it is your duty
and make your mind submissive you can manage easily enough
to feel both. That's the trouble with you as it was with your
mother before you. You don't see your duty and you don't
make your mind submissive. I've no patience with you."</p>

<p>"Grandmother," said Hagar, "did you ever realize that
you yourself only make your mind submissive when it comes
into relation with men, or with ideas advanced by men? I
have never seen you humble-minded with a woman."</p>

<p>Old Miss appeared to take this as a startling proposition,
and to consider it for a moment; then, "I don't know what
you mean."</p>

<p>"I mean that outraged nature must be itself somewhere&mdash;else
there's annihilation."</p>

<p>Old Miss's needles clicked. "I don't pretend to be 'literary,'
or to understand literary talk. What Moses and St.
Paul said and the way we've always done in Virginia is good
enough for me. You're perverse and rebellious as Maria was
before you. It's simple obstinacy, your not caring for Ralph&mdash;and
as for throwing away Medway's million dollars, there
ought to be a law to keep you from doing it!&mdash;Are you going
upstairs? My scrapbook is on the fourth shelf of the big
closet. Get it and read that piece about Ralph."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION</h2>


<p>But the great Gilead Balm explosion came three days later.</p>

<p>It was nearly sunset, and they were all upon the wide, front
porch&mdash;the Colonel, Old Miss, Miss Serena, Captain Bob,
Mrs. LeGrand, Hagar. Ralph was not there, he had ridden
to Hawk Nest, but would return to-night. It had been a
beautiful, early September day, the sky high and blue, the
air all sunny vigour. Gilead Balm sat and enjoyed the cool,
golden, winey afternoon, the shadows lengthening over the
hills, the swallows overhead, the tinkle of the cow-bells. It
was not one of your families that were always chattering.
The porch held rather silent than otherwise. Mrs. LeGrand
could, indeed, keep up a smooth, slow flow of talk, but Mrs.
LeGrand had been packing to return to Eglantine which
would "open" in another week, and she was somewhat
fatigued. The Colonel, pending the arrival of yesterday's
newspaper, was reviewing that of the day before yesterday.
Captain Bob and Lisa communed together. Old Miss knitted.
Miss Serena ran a strawberry emery bag through and
through with her embroidery needle. Hagar had a book, but
she was not reading. It lay face down in her lap; she was
hardly thinking; she was dreaming with her eyes upon a vast
pearly, cumulus cloud, coming up between the spires of the
cedars. A mulatto boy appeared with the mail-bag. "Ha!"
said the Colonel, and stretched out his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a small table beside him. He opened the bag
and turned the contents out upon this, then began to sort
them. No one&mdash;it was a Gilead Balm way&mdash;claimed letter
or paper until the Colonel had made as many little heaps as
there were individuals and had placed every jot and tittle of
mail accruing, ending by shaking out the empty bag. He
did all this to-day. Captain Bob had only a county paper&mdash;no
letters for Old Miss&mdash;a good deal of forwarded mail for
Mrs. LeGrand&mdash;the Colonel's own&mdash;letters and papers
for Hagar. The Colonel handled each piece, glanced at the
superscription, put it in the proper heap. He shook out the
bag; then, gathering up Mrs. LeGrand's mail, gave it to her
with a smile and a small courtly bow. Miss Serena rose,
work in hand, and took hers from the table. Lisa walked
gravely up, then returned to Captain Bob with the county
paper in her mouth. The Colonel's shrunken long fingers
took up Hagar's rather large amount and held it out to her.
"Here, Gipsy"&mdash;the last time for many a day that he called
her Gipsy. A letter slipped from the packet to the floor.
Bending, the Colonel picked it up, and in doing so for the first
time regarded the printing on the upper left-hand corner&mdash;<i>Return
in five days to the &mdash;&mdash; Equal Suffrage League</i>. The
envelope turned in his hand. On its reverse, across the flap,
was boldly stamped&mdash;VOTES FOR WOMEN.</p>

<p>Colonel Argall Ashendyne straightened himself with a
jerk. "Hagar!&mdash;What is that? How do you happen to get
letters like that?&mdash;Answer!"</p>

<p>His granddaughter, who had risen to take her mail, regarded
first the letter and then the Colonel with some astonishment.
"What do you mean, grandfather? The letter's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
from my friend, Elizabeth Eden. I wonder if you don't remember
her, that summer long ago at the New Springs?"</p>

<p>The Colonel's forefinger stabbed the three words on the
back of the envelope. "You don't have friends and correspondents
who are working for <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>"Why not? I propose presently actively to work for it
myself."</p>

<p>Apoplectic silence on the part of the Colonel. The suddenly
arisen storm darted an electric feeler from one to the
other upon the porch.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" demanded Captain Bob. "Something's
the matter!"</p>

<p>Old Miss, who had not clearly caught the Colonel's words,
yet felt the tension and put in an authoritative foot. "What
have you done now, Hagar? Who's been writing to you?
What is it, Colonel?"</p>

<p>Ralph, in his riding-clothes, coming through the hall from
the back where he had just dismounted, felt the sultry hush.
"What's happened? What's the matter, Hagar?"</p>

<p>"Get me a glass of water, Serena!" breathed the Colonel.
He still held the letter.</p>

<p>"My dear friend, let me fan you!" exclaimed Mrs. LeGrand,
and moved to where she could see the offending epistle.
"VOTES FOR&mdash;oh, Hagar, you surely aren't one of <i>those</i>
women!"</p>

<p>Miss Serena, who had flown for the water, returned. The
Colonel drank and the blood receded from his face. The
physical shock passed, there could be seen gathering the
mental lightning. Miss Serena, too, read over his shoulder
"VOTES&mdash; ... Oh, <i>Hagar</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>Hagar laughed&mdash;a cool, gay, rippling sound. "Why,
how round-eyed you all are! It isn't murder and forgery.
Is the word 'rebellion' so strange to you? May I have my
letter, grandfather?"</p>

<p>The Colonel released the letter, but not the situation.
"Either you retire from such a position and such activities,
or you cease to be granddaughter of mine&mdash;"</p>

<p>Old Miss, enlightened by an aside from Mrs. LeGrand,
came into action. "She doesn't mean that she's friends
with those brazen women who want to be men? What's that?
She says she's going to work with them? I don't believe it! I
don't believe that even of Maria's daughter. Going around
speaking and screaming and tying themselves to Houses of
Parliament and interrupting policemen! If I believed it, I
don't think I'd ever speak to her again in this life! Women
Righters and Abolitionists!&mdash;doing their best to drench the
country with blood, kill our people and bring the carpetbaggers
upon us! Wearing bloomers and cutting their hair
short and speaking in town-halls and wanting to change the
marriage service!&mdash;Yes, they do wear bloomers! I saw one
doing it in New York in 1885, when I was there with your
grandfather. And she had short hair&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. LeGrand, as the principal of a School for Young
Ladies, always recognized her responsibility to truth. She
stood up for veracity. "Dear Mrs. Ashendyne, it is not just
like that now. There are a great many more suffragists
now&mdash;so many that society has agreed not to ostracize
them. Some of them are pretty and dress well and have a
good position. I was at a tea in Baltimore and there were
several there. I've even heard women in Virginia&mdash;women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
that you'd think ought to know better&mdash;say that they believed
in it and that sooner or later we'd have a movement
here. Of course, you don't hear that kind of talk, but I can
assure you there's a good deal of it. Of course, I myself
think it is perfectly dreadful. Woman's place is the home.
And we can surely trust <i>everything</i> to the chivalry of our
Southern men. I am sure Hagar has only to think a little&mdash;The
whole thing seems to me so&mdash;so&mdash;so <i>vulgar</i>!"</p>

<p>Miss Serena broke out passionately. "It's against the
Bible! I don't see how any <i>religious</i> woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hagar, who had gone back to her chair, turned her eyes
toward Captain Bob.</p>

<p>"Confound it, Gipsy! What do you want to put your feet
on the table and smoke cigars for?"</p>

<p>Hagar looked at Ralph.</p>

<p>He was gazing at her with eyes that were burning and yet
sullen and angry. "Women, I suppose, have got to have
follies and fads to amuse themselves with. At any rate, they
have them. Suffrage or bridge, it doesn't much matter, so
long as it's not let really to interfere. If it begins to do that,
we'll have to put a stop to it. Woman, I take it, was made
for man, and she'll have to continue to recognize that fact.
Good Lord! It seems to me that if we give her our love and
pay her bills, she might be satisfied!"</p>

<p>All having spoken, Hagar spoke. "I should like, if I may,
to tell you quietly and reasonably why&mdash;" her eyes were
upon her grandfather.</p>

<p>"I wish to hear neither your excuses nor your reasons,"
said the Colonel. "I want to hear a retraction and a promise."</p>

<p>Hagar turned slightly, "Grandmother&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't," said Old Miss, "talk to me! When you're
wrong, you're wrong, and that's all there is to it! Maria
used to try to explain, and then she stopped and I was glad
of it."</p>

<p>Hagar leaned back in her chair and regarded the circle of
her relatives. She felt for a moment more like Maria than
Hagar. She felt trapped. Then she realized that she was
not trapped, and she smiled. Thanks to the evolving whole,
thanks to the years and to her eternal self pacing now
through a larger moment than those moments of old, she
was not by position Maria, she was not by position Miss
Serena. Before her, quiet and fair, opened her Fourth Dimension.
Inner freedom, ability to work, personal independence,
courage and sense of humour and a sanguine mind,
breadth and height of vision, tenderness and hope, her waiting
friends, Elizabeth, Marie, Rachel, Molly and Christopher,
Denny, Rose Darragh, many another&mdash;her work, the story
now hovering in her brain, what other and different work
might rise above the horizon&mdash;the passion to help, help
largely, lift without thinking if it were or were not her share
of the weight&mdash;the universe of the mind, the growing spirit
and the wings of the morning ... there was her land of escape,
real as the hills of Gilead Balm. She crossed the border
with ease; she was not trapped. Even now her subtle self
was serenely over. And the Hagar Ashendyne appearing to
others upon this porch was not chained there, was not riveted
to Gilead Balm. Next week, indeed, she would be gone.</p>

<p>A tenderness came over Hagar for her people. All her
childhood was surrounded by them; they were dear, deep
among the roots of things. She wanted to talk to them; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
longed that they should understand. "If you'd listen," she
said, "perhaps you'd see it a little differently&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Colonel spoke with harshness. "There is no need to
see it differently. It is you who should see it differently."</p>

<p>"It comes of the kind of things you've always read!"
cried Miss Serena. "Books that I wouldn't touch!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Maria was always reading, too," said Old Miss. For
her it <i>was</i> less Hagar than Maria sitting there....</p>

<p>"If it was anything we didn't know, we would, of course,
listen to you, Hagar dear," said Mrs. LeGrand. "I should
be glad to listen anyhow, just as I listened to those two
women in Baltimore. But I must say their arguments
sounded to me very foolish. Ladies in the South certainly
don't need to come into contact with the horrors they talked
about. And I cannot consider the discussion of such subjects
delicate. I should certainly consider it disastrous if my girls
at Eglantine gained any such knowledge. To talk about
their being white slaves and things like that&mdash;it was nauseating!"</p>

<p>"Would you listen, Ralph?" asked Hagar.</p>

<p>"I'll listen to you, Hagar, on any other subject but this."</p>

<p>Mrs. LeGrand's voice came in again. She was fluttering
her fan. "All these theories that you women are advancing
nowadays&mdash;if they <i>paid</i>, if you stood to gain anything by
them, if by advancing them you didn't, so it seems to me,
always come out at the little end of the horn&mdash;people ridiculing
you, society raising its eyebrows, men afraid to marry
you&mdash;! My dear Hagar, men, collectively speaking&mdash;men
don't want women to exhibit mind in all directions. They
don't object to their showing it in certain directions, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
when it comes to women showing it all around the circle they
do object, and from my point of view quite properly! Men
naturally require a certain complaisance and deference from
women. There's no need to overdo it, but a certain amount
of physical and mental dependence they certainly do want!
Well, what's the use of a woman quarrelling with the world
as it's made? Between doing without independent thinking
and doing without an establishment and someone to provide
for you&mdash;! So you see," said Mrs. LeGrand, smoothly argumentative,
"what's the use of stirring up the bottoms of
things? And it isn't as though we weren't really fond of
the men. We are. I've always been fonder of a man, every
time, than of a woman. I must confess I can't see any reason
at all for all this strenuous crying out against good old usage!
Of course a woman with considerable mental power may find
it a little limiting, but there are a lot of women, I assure you,
who never think of it. If there's a little humbug and if some
women suffer, why those things are in the dish, that's all!
The dish isn't all poisoned, and a woman who knows what she
is about can pick and choose and turn everything to account.
I wouldn't know what to do," said Mrs. LeGrand, "with the
dish that people like you would set before us. All this crying
out about evolution and development and higher forms
doesn't touch me in the least! I like the forms we've got.
Perhaps they're imperfect, but the thing is, I feel at home
with imperfection."</p>

<p>She leaned back, in good humour. Hagar had given her an
opportunity to express herself very well. "Don't you, too,"
she asked, "feel at home with the dear old imperfection?"</p>

<p>Hagar met her eyes. "No," she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. LeGrand shrugged. "Oh, well!" she said, "I suppose
each will fight for the place that is home."</p>

<p>Hagar looked beyond her, to her kindred. "You're all opponents,"
she said. "Alike you worship God as Man, and
you worship a static God, never to be questioned nor surpassed.
You have shut an iron door upon yourselves.... One
day you who shut it, you alone&mdash;you will open it, you alone.
But I see that the day is somewhat far."</p>

<p>She rose. "I was going anyhow you know, grandfather,
in four days. But I can take the morning train if you'd
rather?"</p>

<p>But Colonel Ashendyne said stiffly that if she had forgotten
her duty, he had not his, and that the hospitality of Gilead
Balm would be hers, of course, for the four days.</p>

<p>Hagar listened to him, and then she looked once more
around the circle. A smile hovered on her lips and in her
eyes. It broadened, became warm and sweet. "I'll accept
for a time the partial estrangement, but I don't ever mean
that it shall be complete! It takes two to make an estrangement."
She went up to her grandmother and kissed her,
then said that she was going for a walk.&mdash;"No, Ralph,
you are not coming with me!"</p>

<p>She went down the porch steps, and moved away in the
evening glow. The black cedars swallowed her up; then
upon the other side, beyond the gate, she was seen mounting
the hill to the right. The sun was down, but the hilltop
rested against rose-suffused air, and above it swam the evening
star.</p>

<p>Ralph spoke with a certain grim fury. "I wish the old
times were back! Then a man could do what he wished! Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
you didn't feel yourself caught in a net like a cobweb that
you couldn't break&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. LeGrand again opened her fan. "I am very fond, of
course, of dear Hagar, but I must say that she seems to me
intensely unwomanly!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

NEW YORK AGAIN</h2>


<p>It seemed strange to be back at the Maines', staying a fortnight
with Rachel while the apartment was being looked
for. Nothing had been moved in that house; it was all just
the same, only the tone of time was deeper, the furniture
more worn, the prints yellower. She asked for and was
given the third-floor back room again, though, indeed, Mrs.
Maine protested that now that she was famous!... Bessie
had changed as little as the house. More grey hairs, somewhat
more flesh, a great many more pounds of chocolate
creams to her credit&mdash;that seemed all. She was still amiable,
sleepily agreeable, comely, and lazy. Powhatan, except
to grow greyer and leaner, had not altered either. The old
servants held on. With some inevitable variations the same
people came in the evenings&mdash;the Bishop's nephew and the
St. Timothy people, and Powhatan's downtown acquaintances,
and chance visitors from the other side of Mason and
Dixon's.</p>

<p>She noticed a slight difference in the cast of talk. They all
seemed uneasily aware that the world was moving. Mostly
they disapproved and foreboded. She cast her mind back to
that winter of '93-'94. It had been the terrible winter of unemployment,
strikes, widespread discontent. She remembered
clearly how Powhatan had declaimed then against "upsetters"
and what the country was coming to. But now she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
heard him and the Bishop's nephew agree that anti-Christ
and ruin were modern inventions. They sighed for the
halcyon past. "Even ten or twelve years ago, sir, men were
content enough!"</p>

<p>Rachel&mdash;Rachel had not sat still. Rachel had climbed.
She was the old Rachel, but sweetened and broadened.
There was left something of her old manner; she had her
broodings that to the casual eye seemed half-sullen; at the
end of long silences she might flare out, send at table or elsewhere
a flaming, unexpected arrow, but her old ways were
like old clothes, kept half-negligently, worn from habit,
while all the time a fairer, more lately woven garment was in
the wardrobe. She looked no older; she was slight and brown
and somehow velvety. Hagar called her a pansy. She was
no longer tragic, or tragedy had become but a dim background,
a remembered cloud. And she was the strong, sane,
and actual comrade of her children.</p>

<p>Betty and Charley.... Charley was blind. Charley and
Betty had changed, changed more than anybody. Betty
stood a frank, straight young Diana, what she said and did
ringing true. Charley was the student. He had his shelves
of Braille, and his mother's eyes and voice were his at call.
Just now they were doing general history together&mdash;that
was what Charley wanted, to be a historian. Charley and
Betty claimed Hagar for their own. There were her Christmas
letters every year&mdash;wonderful letters&mdash;and her Christmas
gifts, small choice things from every land. They worshipped
her, too, with frankness because she had "done
something"&mdash;because her name counted. Oh, they were
very ambitious, Betty and Charley; filled with ideas, glorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
for the new time, ready to push the world with vigour!
"Oh," cried Hagar, "don't they make you feel timid, cautious,
and conservative?"</p>

<p>She watched with interest to see what effect the two had
upon Powhatan and Bessie. She was forced to the conclusion
that they had very little. They angered Powhatan sometimes,
and he would strike the table and deplore the days of
silent reverence. But he was desperately proud of Betty's
looks, and he had an odd, sneaking pity and fondness for
Charley, and Hagar gathered that he would have sadly
missed them out of the house. As for Bessie, she only gave
her sleepy smile, and said that all children talked foolishly,
but that you didn't have to listen.</p>

<p>Upstairs, at bedtime, now in Rachel's room, now in
Hagar's the two talked together. Daytime, they looked for
Hagar's apartment. They found it at last, high in air, overlooking
the great city; roofs and roofs and roofs at a hundred
levels; curling streamers of white steam like tossed plumes
against the blue sky, bright pennants floating from towering
hotel or department store; a clock below a church spire, with
a gilt weather-cock far above; blurs of occasional trees seen
in some hollow opening; streets far below them, crossing,
crossing&mdash;percolating rivulets of manikins that were people;
roofs and roofs and roofs, and a low perpetual, multitudinous
voice; and the sky over all, high and clear and exhilarating
the day they found the place. "I am going to utter a
bromide," said Hagar. "How marvellous is modern life!"</p>

<p>They went over it again. "Thomasine's room, and a
guest-room, and my room, and a fine room for Mary Magazine
who is coming&mdash;Isham having remarried&mdash;to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
after us, and two baths and a great big library-study-drawing-room,
and a little room for what we please, and plenty of
closets, and a quiet and good café away up on the roof&mdash;Rachel,
it's fine!" They sat on a window-seat and Rachel
produced a pencil and notebook, and together they tinted
the walls and laid rugs and hung pictures and ran bookshelves
around and furnished the apartment. "There! that's
quiet and perfect and not expensive. As Thomson would say,
'It's quite <i>comme il faut</i>, Miss!'"</p>

<p>"Where is Thomson?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Greer, the artist, has taken him over. He wrote me
that he was making thousands, throwing the light on millionaires,
and especially millionairesses, and that he wanted
Thomson, oh, so badly! He's the type that Thomson likes,
and so he joined him two months ago at Newport. Dear old
Thomson! Mahomet has gone back to Alexandria."</p>

<p>They looked around the big room. "Soft lights at night
and all those twinkling stars out there. It's going to be a
dear home."</p>

<p>"You'll have people coming about you. Your own sort&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hagar laughed. "What is my sort? Everybody's my sort."</p>

<p>"Writers&mdash;artists&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hagar pondered the mantel-shelf with a view to what
should go above it. "I don't know many of them. I know
more of them abroad than here. We're a very isolated kind
of craftspeople&mdash;each of us more or less on a little Robinson
Crusoe island of our own. It may be different in New York,
I don't know.... We could do a good deal if we'd put our
heads together and push the same wheel."</p>

<p>The apartment was not to be furnished in a day. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
worked at it in a restful and leisurely manner, and in the
midst of operations, Hagar went to see the Josslyns who had
a house up on the Sound.</p>

<p>That afternoon she and the Josslyns walked by the water
and watched the white sails gliding by the green and rocky
shore, then in the evening sat by a wood fire with cider and
apples. Monday to Friday the children were in town at their
grandmother's, going to school; Friday afternoon they entered
the big living-room like a west wind and danced about
with their mother. A little later the whole family would go
into town; Christopher had had a course of lectures to write
and he was doing it better here. The fire crackled and blazed;
at night through the open windows came in a dim sound of
waves, with passing lights of boats, and the fragrance of the
salt sea, beloved by Hagar. On Monday, when the children
had gone, she drove with Molly deep into the sweet countryside,
and the two talked as the quiet old horse jogged along.... Molly
had taken the advice of the woman at Roger
Michael's dinner-party three years and more ago. She was an
active member of a suffrage organization, deeply interested,
beginning to speak. "I'm a good out-of-doors sort. My voice
carries and I don't have to strain it. Of course, we're just
beginning out-of-doors speaking. I haven't half the intellect
I wish I had, but I can give them good, plain doctrine. It's
so common-sense, after all! And Christopher helps so much.... Oh,
Hagar, when you're truly mated, it's <i>heaven</i>!"</p>

<p>Molly could tell much of the practical working, of the
everyday effort and propaganda. "In two weeks we'll be
back in town, and then if you'll let me take you here and
there&mdash;And when we get back to the house I'll show you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
what I have of the literature we use,&mdash;pamphlets, leaflets,
and so on,&mdash;from John Stuart Mill down to an article
Christopher wrote the other day. We broadcast a great
amount of it in every state, but if we were rich we could
make use of a thousand times more. But we're not rich&mdash;whether
that's to our damnation or our salvation! We have
to make devotion do instead. Then there are the books that
help us, and they are coming out constantly now. And every
now and then we gain a bit of the press. A number of the
magazines help no end. And, of course, we speak and have
meetings and work quietly, each among her own acquaintance.
It's to educate&mdash;educate&mdash;educate! We're just at
the beginning of things. There were the early stages and the
heroic women who blazed the trail. They're all going,&mdash;Miss
Anthony died last March,&mdash;and their time is merging
into our time, and now the trail's a roadway and there are
thousands on it, and still we're just at the beginning&mdash;"</p>

<p>Molly could tell, too, something of the personality of the
women eminent in the movement. "The really eminent to-day
are not always those whose names the reporters catch,
and <i>vice versa</i>. And while the papers talk of 'leaders,' I do
not think that, in the man's sense, they are leaders at all. We
do not hurrah for any woman as the men do for Mr. Roosevelt
or Mr. Bryan. The movement goes without high priests
and autocrats and personifications. We haven't, I suppose,
the Big Chief tradition. Perhaps woman's individualism has
a value after all. It's like religion when it really is personal;
your idea of good remains your idea of good; it doesn't take
on a human form. Or perhaps we're merely tired of crooking
the knee. I don't know. The fact remains."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>They jogged along by country roads and orchards. "It's
the most worth-<i>while</i> thing!" said Molly. "Nobody can
explain it, but every one who takes hold of it <i>deep</i> feels it. I
heard a woman say the other day that it was like going out of
a close room into ozone and wind and the blue lift of the sky.
She said she felt as though she had wings! Discouragements?
Cartloads of them! But somehow they don't matter. Nor
do mistakes. Of course we make them&mdash;but the next time
we do better."</p>

<p>The witching autumn week with the Josslyns over, Hagar
went back to town, and, as she had promised, to the Settlement
for three days.</p>

<p>The Settlement! The first day she had seen it came back
clearly; the harsh, biting day and the search for Thomasine,
and Omega Street, and then how wonderful the old house
had seemed to her, going over it with Elizabeth. It was
shrunken now, of course, in size and marvel, but it was still
a grave and pleasant place of fine uses. She had visited it
before during this month, and she had marked certain
changes. A few of the people in residence years before were
here yet, others were gone, others of later years had come in.
But it was not only people; other changes appeared. She
found exhibited a deep skepticism of certain Danaïdes'
labours still favoured or tolerated so many years ago. The
policies of the place were bolder and larger; every one was at
once more radical and more serene.</p>

<p>Marie Caton met her. "Elizabeth has a committee meeting,
and then she speaks to-night at Cooper Union: <i>Women in
the Sweated Trades</i>. I haven't had you to myself hardly ever!
Now I'm going to."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't I go to Cooper Union to-night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I'm going, too. It's an important meeting.
But I've got you for a whole two hours, and nowadays that's
a long and restful sojourn together! Get your things off and
we'll take possession of Elizabeth's sitting-room."</p>

<p>In Elizabeth's room, with her books, with the Psyche and
the Botticelli Judith and the Mona Lisa and the drawing of
the Sphinx, they talked of twenty things, finally of the Settlement's
specific activities, old ones carried on, new ones
embarked in; then, "But more and more you get drawn&mdash;or
I get drawn&mdash;into the ocean of China Awake."</p>

<p>"China Awake?"</p>

<p>"Women Awake. It's an ocean all right, with an ocean's
possibilities."</p>

<p>"I don't think it's women only who are waking, Marie.
Women and men, all of us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I agree," said Marie. "But it wasn't just natural sleepy-headedness
with women. They've been drugged&mdash;given
knock-out drops, so to speak. They have a long way to wake
up."</p>

<p>Hagar mused, her eyes upon the drawing. "Yes, a good,
long way.... There must have been a lot of pristine
strength."</p>

<p>"Well, it's coming out. All kinds of things are coming out
with an accent on qualities they didn't think she had."</p>

<p>"Yes. The world <i>is</i> rather in the position of the hen with
the duckling&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The kind of thing we read and hear at this place emphasizes,
of course, the economic and sociological side. It's to be
the Century of Fair Distribution, of Social Organization, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Humanism&mdash;<i>ergo</i>, Woman Also. Which, of course, is all
right, but I'd put an infinite plus to that."</p>

<p>"And Elizabeth?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Elizabeth is a saint! What she thinks of is the
sweated woman and the little children, and the girl who goes
under&mdash;most often is pushed under. It's what we see down
here; it's the starved bodies and minds, the slow dying of
fatigue, the monstrous wrong of the Things Withheld that's
moving her. Of course, we all think of that. How can any
thinking woman not think of that? She wants the vote to
use as a lever, and so do I, and so do you.... But behind all
that, in the place where I myself live," said Marie, with
sudden passion, "I am fighting to be myself! I am fighting
for that same right for the other woman! I am fighting for
plain recognition of an equal humanity!"</p>

<p>There was a crowd that night at Cooper Union. Elizabeth
spoke; a grave, strong talk, followed with attention, clapped
with sincerity. After her there spoke an A. F. of L. man.
"Women have got to unionize. They've got to learn to keep
step. They've got to learn that the good of one is wrapped
up in the good of all. They've got to learn to strike. They've
got to learn to strike not only for themselves, but for the
others. They've got to get off their little, just-standing-room
islands, and think in terms of continents. They've got
to get an idea of solidarity&mdash;"</p>

<p>When he had taken his seat came an announcement, made
with evident satisfaction. "We did not know it until a few
minutes ago. We thought she was still in the West&mdash;but we
are so fortunate as to have with us to-night&mdash;Rose Darragh!"
Applause broke forth at once.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

ROSE DARRAGH</h2>


<p>Rose Darragh's short speech, at once caustic and passionate,
ended&mdash;the meeting ended. Hagar waited below the
platform.</p>

<p>Rose Darragh, at last shaking off the crowd, came toward
her. "I've been looking at you. I seem, somehow, to know
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I you. And not&mdash;which is strange to me&mdash;not
through another."</p>

<p>"Is your name Hagar Ashendyne?"</p>

<p>Hagar nodded. "We can't talk well here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm in New York for two weeks. Denny's in Chicago
and I join him there. Let me see&mdash;where can we meet?
Will you come to my flat?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and in a few days I shall have my own rooms. I
want to see you there, too, Rose Darragh."</p>

<p>"I'll come. This is my address. Will you come to-morrow
at four?"</p>

<p>Hagar went. Denny had written that the two lived
"handy to their work," and it was apparent that they did.
The flat had the dignity of Spartan simplicity. In it Rose
Darragh moved with the fire of the ruby.</p>

<p>"Denny had to go about the paper. Oh, it's doing well,
the paper! It's Denny's idol. He serves in the temple day
and night, and when the idol asks it, he'll give his heart's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
blood.... You liked Denny very much, didn't you?&mdash;in
Nassau, three years ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did." They were sitting in the plain, bare room,
attractive, for it was so clean, the late autumn sunlight
streaming in at the curtainless windows. "Yes, I did. I
liked him so well that ... I had somewhat of a fight with
myself.... I am telling you that," said Hagar, "because I
want your friendship. It is over now, nor do I think it will
come again."</p>

<p>Rose Darragh gave her a swift look from heel to head.
"That's strength. I like strength.... All right! I'm not
afraid."</p>

<p>They sat in silence for a moment; then, "I wish you'd tell
me," said Hagar, "about your work."</p>

<p>A very few days after this she took possession of the apartment,
and at once made it a home. There was a housewarming
with Rachel and Betty and Charley and Elizabeth
and Marie and the Josslyns, and two pleasant gentlemen, her
publishers, and a fellow-writer or two whom she was by way
of knowing and liking, and an artist, and an old scholar and
philosopher whom she had known abroad and loved and
honoured. And there was Thomasine, a little worn and
faded, but with happiness stealing over her, and Mary
Magazine busy with the cakes and ale. There couldn't have
been a better housewarming.</p>

<p>Thomasine&mdash;Thomasine began to bloom afresh. Factory
and department store and business school and office lay
behind her&mdash;each a stage upon a somewhat dull and dusty
and ambuscade-beset road of life. Business school and office,
training for mind and fingers alike, a resulting "place" with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
fair-dealing firm&mdash;all that was Hagar's helping, a matter of
the last six or seven years. And now Hagar had come back
and had made Thomasine an offer, and Thomasine closed
with it very simply and gladly. She had from the beginning
worked hard and as best she could and had given good value
for her pay; and now she was going still to do all that, but to
do it with a singing heart and her hunger for beauty and fitness
fed. The colour came back into her cheeks; she began
to take on a sprite-like beauty. She brought seriously into
conversation one day the fact that she had always been good
at finding four-leafed clovers.... Jim and Marietta were
doing fairly, still over in New Jersey. "Fairly" meant a poor
house which Marietta did her best to keep clean, and two of
the children working, and the city for summer and winter,
and Jim's pay envelope neither larger nor heavier, but the
cost of living both. But Jim had his "job," and Marietta
was not so ailing as she used to be, and the two children
brought in a little, and Thomasine helped each month; so
they might be said to be doing much better than many others.
There was even talk of being able one day to get&mdash;the whole
family being fond of music&mdash;one of the cheaper phonographs.</p>

<p>Hagar and Thomasine worked through the mornings,
Hagar thinking, remembering, creating; Thomasine taking
from her the labour of record; caring also for her letters and
the keeping of accounts and all small, recurring business.
And Thomasine loved to do any shopping that arose to be
done,&mdash;which was well, for Hagar hated shopping,&mdash;and
loved to keep the apartment "just so." The two lived in
quiet, harmonious intercourse, together in working hours, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
when working hours were over, each going freely her individual
way. Thomasine, too, had friends. She wrote to Jim
and Marietta and to Maggie at home, taking care of the
mother with the spine, that she hadn't been so happy since
they used to go to grandmother's at Gilead Balm....</p>

<p>Rose Darragh&mdash;Rose Darragh had not been at Hagar's
housewarming. She was speaking that night in Newark.
But some days afterwards she came&mdash;came late one afternoon
with the statement that she had the evening free. She
and Thomasine and Hagar dined in the café together, but
Thomasine hurried through her dinner, for she was going to
the theatre with a fellow-stenographer with whom she had
worked for two years downtown, and who was "such a nice
girl," and with the stenographer's brother, who looked like a
nice brother. Hagar and Rose Darragh, left at the table, sipped
their coffee.</p>

<p>A quality of Rose Darragh's came out. She observed and
deduced, to the amusement of herself and of others, with the
swiftness and accuracy of M. Dupin or of Mr. Sherlock
Holmes. They had a small corner table commanding the
long, bright room. "Twenty tables," she said. "Men and
women and a fair number of children. Not proportionately
so large a number as once there would have been, and that is
well, the bawlers of race-suicide to the contrary!&mdash;I'm
interested in the women just now. Man's had the centre of
the stage for so long!&mdash;and, of course, we know that this is
the Century of the Child&mdash;see cotton-mills, glass-works,
and canneries. But Woman&mdash;Woman's just coming out of
the wings.... There's rather an interesting collection here
to-night. Do you know any of them?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have spoken casually to several. I have been here, you
know, only the shortest time."</p>

<p>"There's a woman over there who has a wonderful face&mdash;brooding
and wise.... A teacher isn't she? I should say she
was not married."</p>

<p>"Yes; she is a teacher, and single."</p>

<p>"There's a woman who is a nurse."</p>

<p>"Yes. There's a sick child in that family. But she is not
in uniform to-night."</p>

<p>"I know her all the same. She's a good nurse. There are
those who are and those who aren't. But she's got strength
and poise and knows what she is about and is kind.&mdash;Those
two women over there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. What do you make of them?"</p>

<p>"There's such a glitter of diamonds you can't see the
women. Poor things!&mdash;to be beings of a single element&mdash;to
live in a world of pure carbon&mdash;to be the hardest thing
there is, and yet be so brittle too!... The woman next them
is good ordinary: nothing remarkable, and yet pleasant
enough. The worst that can be said of her is that she doesn't
discriminate. If the broth lacks salt, she never knows it."</p>

<p>"And the two over there with the stout man?"</p>

<p>Rose Darragh gazed a moment with eyes slightly narrowed.
"Oh, those!" she said. "Those are our adapted women&mdash;perilously
near adapted, at any rate. That's a sucking wife
and daughter. Take your premise that in the divine order of
things the male opens the folds of his being, surrounds, encloses,
'shelters' and 'protects' and 'provides for' your
female in season and out of season, when there is need, and
when there is certainly none, and your further premise that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
the female is willing and ruthlessly logical&mdash;and behold the
supremely natural conclusion!... Daughters of the horse
leech&mdash;and perfectly respectable members of society as
constituted! Faugh!&mdash;with their mouths glued to that fat
man's pocket. He looks haggard, and at the moment he's
probably grinding the faces of no end of men and women,&mdash;not
because he's got a bad heart and really wants to,&mdash;but
because he's got to 'provide' for those two perfectly strong
and healthy persons in jewelry and orchids! He's cowed by
tradition into accepting the monstrous position, and he's
weak enough to let them define what is 'provision.' He's got
to keep filling and filling the pocket because they suck so
fast."</p>

<p>"Do you think they can change?"</p>

<p>"They can be forced to change. They don't want to
change, any more than the copepod wants to change. And
logically, while he persists in his present attitude, the man
can't ask them to change. He can't keep his cake and eat it
too." She drank her coffee. "That very stout gentleman
who is being driven to bankruptcy, or to ways that are queer,
is just the kind to strike the table with his fist and violently
to assure you that God meant Woman, lovely Woman! to be
dependent upon Man, and that it is with deep regret that he
sees woman crowding into industry and beating at the doors
of the professions&mdash;Woman, Wife and Mother, God bless
her! Do you notice how they always put Wife first? If the
Association Opposed to the Extension of the Franchise to
Women asked him to-night for a contribution, they'd probably
get it."</p>

<p>"How numerous do you think are those women?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>"The copepods? Numerous enough, pity 'tis! But not so
numerous as, given the System, you might fairly expect:
numerous positively, but not relatively. And a lot of them
have simply succumbed to environmental pressure. Given a
generation or two of rational training and a nobler ideal of
what befits a human being, and the copepod will yet succour
herself.... Denny and I see more of the other kind. The
drudges outnumber the copepods, and neither need be....
There's a girl over there I like&mdash;the one with the braided
hair. Many of the young girls of to-day are rather wonderful.
It's going to be interesting to see what they'll do when they're
older, and what their daughters will do. She's got a fine head&mdash;mathematics,
I should think."</p>

<p>They went down together.</p>

<p>In the large and comfortable half study, half drawing-room
with the shaded lights, with the sea-like sound of the
city without the windows, with the books and pictures, they
walked a little to and fro together, and at last paused before a
window and looked forth&mdash;the firmament studded with
lights above and the city studded with lights below. "There's
a noble word called Work," said Rose Darragh, "and we have
degraded it into Toil, on the one hand, and it has a strong
enemy called False Ideals, on the other. What I ask of Life is
that I may be one of the helpers to save Work from Toil and
False Ideals."</p>

<p>They watched the lights in silence, then turned back to the
soft glowing room. When each had taken a deep chair on
either side of the great library table, they still kept silent.
Rose Darragh sat erect, lithe, strong, embrowned, a wine red
in her cheeks. As in the picture that Hagar remembered, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
strong throat rose clear from a blouse of the simplest make,
only a soft dark silk instead of wool in honour of the evening.
Her skirt was of dark cheviot. She wore no stays, it was
evident, and needed none. Her hair, of a warm chestnut,
wavy and bright, was cut to about the length worn by
Byron and Keats and Shelley.... To a marked extent she
was interest-provoking; there was felt a powerful nature,
rich and indomitable.</p>

<p>Presently she spoke. "Denny will be home next week.
Don't you want me to take you one day to see the shrine
where he keeps his idol and watch him providing acceptable
sacrifice? It's rich&mdash;the editorial room of 'Onward!'"</p>

<p>"Yes, I should like it very much."</p>

<p>"Then we'll go down some morning soon. There's a place
near the temple where they give you a decent omelette and
cheese. We'll all three go there for luncheon.... Denny's
fine."</p>

<p>"I'm very sure of that."</p>

<p>"Yes, warp and woof, he's sincere&mdash;and that's what I
worship, sincerity! And he's able. He strikes more narrowly
than I do, but he strikes deep. We've lived and worked
together now eight years. We've seen hard times together.
We've nearly starved together. We've made a name and
come out together. And, bigger than our own fates, we've
seen our Cause bludgeoned and seen it lift its bleeding head.
We've known together impersonal sorrow and joy, humbling
and pride, fear and faith, despair and hope. Denny and I are
the best friends. We've been lovers in the flesh, but there's
something better than that between us." She turned square
to the light and Hagar. "That's the truest truth, and yet I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
want to tell you that I think you've always been to him a
kind of unearthly and spiritual romance. He's kept you
lifted, moving above him in the clouds, beckoning, with a
light about you. And I want to tell you that I have not
grudged that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I spoke to you as I did the other day," said Hagar,
"because, somehow, I had that impulse. It was not necessary
that I should do so; that of which I spoke had long passed."
She rose and walked slowly back and forth in the room.
"When I bethought myself, that month in Nassau, of where
I&mdash;not he&mdash;was drifting ... I was able then to leave that
current, and leave it not to reënter. That was three years
ago. I beg you to believe that that temptation, if it was a
temptation, is far behind me. My soul will not return that
way, cannot return that way.... And now I simply want to
be friends."</p>

<p>"I'll meet you there. I like you too much not to want to.
You seem to me one of those rare ones who find their lamp
and refuge in themselves."</p>

<p>"And I like you, extraordinarily. I should like to work
with you."</p>

<p>"There is nothing," said Rose Darragh, "any easier to
arrange than that."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX<br />

AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE</h2>


<p>In the year 1910, a certain large gathering of suffragists
occurring in New York, permission was sought and obtained
for speaking in Union Square. Here and there, beneath the
trees, sprang temporary tribunes sheathed with bunting the
colour of gold; above them banners and banneroles of the
same hue, black-lettered, VOTES FOR WOMEN. From
each tribune now a woman was speaking, now a man. About
speakers and tribunes pressed the crowd, good-natured, commenting,
earnest in places. Each speaker had about ten
minutes; time up, he or she stepped down; another took
position. Sometimes the crowd laughed at a good story or at
a barbed shaft skilfully shot; sometimes it applauded; sometimes
it indulged in questions. Its units continually shifted;
one or more speakers at this stand listened to, it went roaming
for pastures new and brought up before the next tribune,
whose crowd, roaming in its turn, filled the just vacated
spaces. It was a still, pearl-grey mid-afternoon, the pale-brown
leaves falling from the trees, the roar of the city softened,
the square's frontier lines of tall buildings withdrawn,
a little blurred, made looming and poetic. All was a picture,
lightly shifting with gleams of gold and a woman's voice,
earnest, lilting. The crowd increased until there was a great
crowd. VOTES FOR WOMEN&mdash;VOTES FOR WOMEN&mdash;said
the banners and the banneroles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>A man and a woman, leaving a taxicab on the Broadway
facet of the Square, stood a moment upon the pavement.
"What a crowd!" said the man. "There is speaking of some
kind." He stopped a boy. "What is going on?"</p>

<p>"Suffragettes! Women speaking. Want ter vote. Ain't
got no husbands.&mdash;<i>I</i> wouldn't let 'em! Say, ain't they
gettin' too big for their places?" The boy stuck out his
tongue and went away.</p>

<p>"Young hoodlum!" exclaimed the man with disgust.</p>

<p>"Let us stay and hear them for a while. I never have."</p>

<p>"All right!&mdash;I'll pay the cab." He came back to her, and
they moved across and under the trees. "Are you interested?"</p>

<p>"I think I am. I haven't made up my mind. We're so
far South that as a movement it's all as yet only a rather
distant sound. How do you feel about it?"</p>

<p>"Why, I think it's an honest proposition. I've never seen
why not. We're all human together, aren't we? But building
bridges for South American Governments has kept me,
too, a little out of earshot. I see what the papers say, and
they're saying a good deal."</p>

<p>"Ours chiefly confine themselves to being scandalized by
the English Militants."</p>

<p>"Then your papers are very foolish. Who ever supposed
there weren't Jacobins in every historic struggle for liberty?
Sometimes they help and sometimes they hinder, and sometimes
they do both at once. It's rather superficial to see only
the 'left,' and not the movement of which it is the 'left.'"</p>

<p>They came beneath the trees upon the fringe of the crowd
about one of the gold-swathed stands. This was an attentive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
crowd, not restless but listening, slanted forward. The man
from the taxicab touched a young workman upon the arm.
"Who is it speaking?" The other turned a pale, tense face.
"It's one that can hold them. It's Rose Darragh, speaking
for the working-women."</p>

<p>The two made their way to where they could see and hear.
Rose Darragh, speaking with a lifted irony and passion, sent
her last Parthian arrow, paused a moment, then cried with a
vibrant voice, "Give the working-woman a vote!" and
stepped back and down from the stand. "By George!"
breathed the man from the cab. The crowd applauded&mdash;for
such a meeting applauded loudly.</p>

<p>The young man to whom the two had appealed cried out
also. "Give the working-woman a vote! She's working dumb
and driven under your factory laws! Give her the vote!"</p>

<p>A large, bald-headed, stubborn-jawed man who had been
making <i>sotto-voce</i> remarks, turned with anger. "And have
them striking at the polls as well as striking in the shop!
Doubling the ignorant vote and getting into the way of business!
You'd better listen to what I tell you! Woman's place
is at home&mdash;damn her!"</p>

<p>The man next him was a clergyman. "I agree with you,
sir, that woman's place is the home, but I object to your
expletive!"</p>

<p>The bald-headed man was willing to be placatory. "Well,
Reverend, if we're only two words apart&mdash;Are you going
to stay here? I'm not! I don't believe in encouraging
them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I believe you to be right there, sir. Woman's Sphere&mdash;"
they went off together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>The man from the cab, John Fay by name, with his sister-in-law,
Lily Fay, who had been Lily Goldwell, moved still
nearer the front. They could see Rose Darragh pausing for
a moment beside the stand before she went away to another
tribune. A woman dressed in wood-brown spoke to her
laughing; then, a hand on her shoulder, mounted to the
platform.</p>

<p>Two women behind Lily Fay whispered together excitedly,
"Hagar Ashendyne?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I didn't know she was going to speak to-day&mdash;but
she and Rose Darragh often do speak together. They're
great friends.... Somebody ought to tell them who she is&mdash;Oh!
they know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Shh!</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's holding them&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lily Fay clutched her companion's arm. "Hagar Ashendyne!
I went to school with her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The writer?"</p>

<p>"Yes. How strange it seems.... Oh, listen!"</p>

<p>Hagar's voice came to them, silver clear as a swinging bell.
"Men and women&mdash;I am going to tell you why a woman
like myself finds herself to-day under a mental and moral
compulsion consciously to further what is called the Woman
Movement&mdash;"</p>

<p>She spoke for ten minutes. When she ended and stepped
from the platform, there followed a moment of silence, then
applause broke forth. A dark-eyed, breathless girl, a lettered
ribbon across her coat, caught her hand. "Hurry! We're
waiting for you at the next stand. Rose Darragh is just
through&mdash;" The two hastened away together, lithe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
free beneath the falling brown leaves. A Columbia man was
speaking well for the Men's League, but a good proportion of
the crowd, John and Lily Fay among them, followed the
wood-brown skirt.</p>

<p>They followed from stand to stand during the next hour, at
the end of which time speaking was over for that day. The
crowd broke up; the speakers, after some cheerful talk among
themselves, gathered together their banners and pennants
and went their several ways; committees looked after the
taking-down of the stands.</p>

<p>Lily went over to Hagar Ashendyne standing with Rose
Darragh and Molly Josslyn, talking to a little group of
friendly people. "I'm Lily Goldwell. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>Hagar put her arms about her. "Oh, Lily, how is your
head? Have you got that menthol pencil still?"</p>

<p>"My head got better and I threw it away. Oh, Hagar, you
are a sight for sair een!... Yes, I'm Lily Fay, now. I'm on
my way to England to join my husband. The boat sails next
week. I'm at the &mdash;&mdash;. This is my brother-in-law, John Fay."</p>

<p>"I've got to be at Carnegie Hall to-night," said Hagar.
"And I have something to do to-morrow through the day&mdash;but
the evening's free. Won't you come to dinner with me&mdash;both
of you? Yes, I want you, want you bad! Come early&mdash;come
at six."</p>

<p>To-morrow was the serenest autumn day. Lily and John
Fay walked from their hotel through a twilight tinted like a
shell. When they came to the apartment house and were
carried up, up, and left the elevator and rang at the door
before them and it opened and they were admitted by a tidy
coloured maid, it was to find themselves a little in advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
of their hostess. Mary Magazine explained with slow, soft
courtesy. "Miss Hagar cert'n'y meant to be home er long
time befo' you come, she cert'n'y did. But there's er big
strike goin' on&mdash;er lot of sewing-women&mdash;an' she went with
Miss Elizabeth Eden early this mahnin', an' erwhile ago she
telephone if you got heah first, you must 'scuse her anyhow
an' make yo'selves at home 'cause she'll be heah presently.
She had," Mary Magazine explained further, "to send Miss
Thomasine to see somebody for her in Boston, so there isn't
anybody to entertain you twel she comes. If you'll just make
yo'selves comfortable&mdash;" and Mary Magazine smiled slowly
and disappeared.</p>

<p>The large room had not greatly altered in appearance since
Rachel and Hagar first arranged it, three years ago. There
were more books, a few more prints, more signed photographs,
a somewhat richer tone of time. It was a good room,
quiet and fine, not lacking an air of nobility. A great bough
of red autumn leaves flamed at one end like a stained-glass
window. A door opening into a small room showed a typewriter
and a desk piled with work. The two visitors, with
fifteen minutes of sole possession before them, strolled to the
windows and admired the far-flung, grandiose view, twilight
beginning to be starred with the city lights; then turned
back to the room and its strong charm.</p>

<p>"We've lived through the revolution, I think," said John
Fay. "The senses move more slowly than the event. We're
just taking it in, and we call it all to make. But it's really
made."</p>

<p>"I see what you mean. But they&mdash;but we&mdash;have all
this monstrous amount of hard work yet&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. Introducing the revolution to the slow-minded. But
I gather it's being done." He moved about the room, looking
at the photographs. "Artists and thinkers and world-builders,
men and women.... Those years down there
around the Equator, I could at least take the magazines, and
I got each twelvemonth a box of books. I know all these
people. I used to feel quite intimate with them, down there
building bridges.... Building bridges is great work. I
believe in it thoroughly and quite enjoy doing it.... And
these are bridge-builders, too, and I had a fraternal feeling.
I've cut their pictures, men and women, from the magazines
and stuck them up in my hut and said good-morning and
good-evening to them." He had the pleasantest, humorous
eyes, and now they twinkled. "Sometimes I like them so well
that I really kow-towed to them. And I've laid a platonic
sprig of flowers before more than one of these women's
pictures. Perhaps I'd better not tell her so, but there was a
picture of Hagar Ashendyne&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door opened and Hagar entered. She wore the wood-brown
dress of yesterday&mdash;she was somewhat pale, with
circles under her eyes. "Ah, I am sorry!" she said, "but I
could not help it. The strike ... and they send the girls to
the Island. Two or three of us went to the court&mdash;oh, the
snaky, blind thing we call Justice!" Her eyes filled. "Pardon!
but if you had been there&mdash;" She caught herself up,
dashed the moisture from her eyes and said&mdash;and looked&mdash;that
she was glad to see them. "We'll put the things away
that make your heart ache! I'll go and change, and we'll eat
our dinner and have a pleasant, pleasant time!"</p>

<p>In a very little while she was back, dressed in white, amethysts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
in an old and curious setting about her throat. They
had been Maria's, and to-night she looked like Maria, lines
of the haunted mind about her mouth and between her eyes.
Only it was not her personal fate that troubled her, but a
wider haunting. At dinner, in the café at the corner table,
she told them, when they asked her, a little of where she had
been and what she had done during the day, told them of this
pitiful case and of that. Then after a moment's silence she
said resolutely, "Don't let us talk about these things any
more. Let us talk about happy things. Talk to me about
yourself, Lily!"</p>

<p>"There isn't much to tell," said Lily; "I've been quite
terribly sheltered. For years I was ill, and then I grew better.
I've travelled a little, and I like Maeterlinck and Vedanta
and Bergson, and I play the violin not so badly, and Robert,
my husband, is very good to me. I haven't grown much, I
am afraid, since I was at Eglantine. But more and more
continually I want to grow. Do you remember, at Eglantine&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dinner was not long. They came down to the grave and
fair room with the scarlet autumn leaves and the books, and
here Mary Magazine gave them coffee. They sat in their
deep chairs and drank it slowly. The talk dropped; they sat
in a thoughtful mood. John Fay had a long and easy figure, a
bronzed, clean-shaven, humorous face and sea-blue eyes. Lily
was slender as a willow wand, with colourless, strong features.
Her eyes were dreamy&mdash;Hagar remembered how she sat
and looked into the fire when they read poetry. Like the
faintest, faraway strain of a music not altogether welcome, a
line went through her mind,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
"Where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiles<br />
Miles and miles&mdash;"<br />
</div>

<p>Hagar, with her odd, pensive, enigmatical face, drove the
strain back to the limbo whence it came. She and Lily talked
of the girls so long ago at Eglantine, of Sylvie and Francie and
all the rest, the living and the dead, and the scattered fates.
Neither had ever been back to the school, but she could tell
Lily of Mrs. LeGrand's health and prosperity. "You don't
like her," said Lily. "I was so ill and homesick, I didn't
have energy one way or the other, but she was very smooth,
I remember that, ... and we were all to marry, and only
to marry&mdash;marry money and social position&mdash;especially
social position." They talked of the teachers. "I liked Miss
Gage," said Hagar, "and Mrs. Lane was a gentle, sweet
woman. Do you remember M. Morel?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and Mr. Laydon."</p>

<p>Lily started. "Oh, Hagar, I had forgotten that! But perhaps
there was nothing in it&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hagar laughed. "If you meant that at eighteen I sincerely
thought I loved Mr. Laydon&mdash;and that he, as sincerely, I
do believe, thought that he loved me&mdash;yes, there was that
in it! But we found out with fair promptness that it was false
fire.&mdash;I have not seen nor heard of him for many years. He
taught at Eglantine for a while, and then he went, I believe, to
some Western school.... Lily, Lily! I have had a long life!"</p>

<p>"I have had as long a one in years," said Lily. "But yours
has been the fuller. You have a wonderful life."</p>

<p>"We all have wonderful lives," answered Hagar. "One is
rich after this fashion, one after that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>The bell rang. In another moment Denny Gayde came
into the big room. The six years since the Nassau month had
wrought little outer change. He was still somewhat thin and
worn, with a face at once keen and quiet, a little stern, with
eyes that saw away, away&mdash;He was more light than heat,
but there was warmth, too, and it glowed and deepened all
around "Onward!" When he said the name of his paper, it
was as though he caressed it. He was like a lighthouse-keeper
whose whole being had become bent, on a wreck-strewn
shore, to tending and heightening the light, to sending the
rays streaming across the reefs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI<br />

JOHN FAY</h2>


<p>"Denny," said Hagar, "ask Mary Magazine to give you a
coffee-cup." Denny came back with it and she filled it from
the silver urn. "Rose went to Brooklyn to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes.&mdash;I was to have spoken down on Omega Street, but
at the last moment Harding came in and I sent him instead.
'Onward!' 's got the strongest kind of stuff this week, and
there are some finishing touches&mdash;I'm going back to the
office in an hour or two. Rose said that she asked you for
that poem, and that you said you would give it, and she
thought you might have it ready. I've got a telling place
for it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Drink your coffee and talk to the others while I copy it
out," said Hagar. She rose and went to the desk in the
smaller room. When she came back, Lily was dreaming with
her eyes upon the forest bough, and the two men sat discussing
Syndicalism. She laid a folded piece of paper upon the
table beside Denny's hand. "There are only three verses."</p>

<p>He opened the paper and read them. "Thank you, Hagar!
You've struck it home."</p>

<p>He refolded the paper and was about to put it in his
pocket when John Fay held out his hand. "Mayn't I see it,
too?" He looked at Hagar.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, if you wish."</p>

<p>Fay read it, held the paper in his hand for a moment, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
gave it back to Denny. "I wish I could write like that," he
said.</p>

<p>His tone was so oddly humble that Hagar laughed. "I
wish that I could build great bridges across deep rivers!" she
said.</p>

<p>They sat and talked, and the poem gave leadings to their
talk, though they did not speak of the poem. At first it was
Fay, answering Hagar's questions, telling of the struggle of
muscle and brain with the physical earth, of mountain-piercing,
river-spanning, harbour-making. He was thirty-nine;
he had been engineering, building in strange and desert
places since he was a boy; he had a host of memories of
struggles, now desperate and picturesque, now patient and
drudging, grapples of mind with matter, first-hand encounters
with solids and liquids and gases. He had had to manage
men in order to manage these; he had had to know how to
manage men. Born with an enquiring mind, he learned as he
went along his governments and peoples, their customs, institutions,
motor-faiths, strengths and weaknesses; also he
knew the natural history of places, and loved Mother Earth
and a good part of her progeny. He had also a defined, quizzical
humour which saved the day for him when it grew too
strenuous. He talked well, with a certain drawling fitness of
phrase which brought Medway into Hagar's mind, but not
unpleasantly. There had been much in Medway which she
had liked.</p>

<p>Fay was no monopolist. The talk went from one to another,
and Denny drew more into it. He had been listening
attentively to Fay. "It's your work," he said, "and it's
tremendous and basic work. You've been doing it through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
the ages ever since it first occurred to us that we could
lengthen an arm with a stick and crack a nut&mdash;or an enemy's
head&mdash;with a stone. It's tremendous and basic still.
And the people who work under your direction, and atom
by atom give you power?"</p>

<p>"Why, one day," said Fay, "they'll work as artists. A far
day, doubtless, and there are degrees in artists; but I see no
other conclusion. And to give the artist component in the
mass of humanity a chance to strengthen and come out is, I
take it, the tremendous and basic work to which we've all got
to devote the next century or two."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're all right!" said Denny.</p>

<p>Hagar smiled. "My old 'News from Nowhere'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But with a difference," said Denny. "Morris's was an
over-simplified dream."</p>

<p>"Yes; we are more complex and flowing than that. But it
was lovely. Do you remember the harvest home, and the
masons, so absorbed and happy in their building ... like
children, and yet conscious artists, buoyant, free&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fay looked at her. "What," he said, "is <i>your</i> vision of the
country that is coming?"</p>

<p>Her candid eyes met his. "I have no clear vision," she
said. "Visions, too, are flowing. The vision of to-day is not
that of yesterday and to-morrow's may be different yet.
Moreover, I don't want to fix a vision, to mount it like a
butterfly and keep it with the life gone out. We've done too
much of that all along the way behind us. Vision grows, and
who wishes to say 'Lo, the beautiful End!' There is no End.
I do not wish a rigid mind, posturing before one altar-piece.
Pictures dissolve and altars are portable."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Denny, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lily says she reads Vedanta. Well, it is the Yogi's
<i>Neti&mdash;neti!</i> Almost your only possible definition as yet
is, 'Not this&mdash;not this!' The country that is coming&mdash;It
is not capitalism, though capitalism is among its ancestors.
It is not war, though in the past it warred. It is not
ecclesiasticism, though ecclesiasticism, too, was an inn on its
road. It is not sex-aristocracy, though that, too, is behind
it; it is not preoccupation with sex at all. It is not sectionalism,
nor nationalism, nor imperialism. It is not racial
arrogance. It is not arrogance at all. It is not exploitation.
It is not hatred. It is not selfishness. It is not lust. It is not
bigotry. It is not ignorance, or pride in ignorance.&mdash;<i>Neti,
neti!</i>... It is beauty&mdash;and truth.... And always greater....
And it comes by knowledge, out of which grows understanding,
and by courage, out of which come great actions."</p>

<p>She ceased to speak, and leaned back in her chair, her hand
at the amethysts about her throat. Fay kept his eyes upon
her. He was conscious of a resurgence of a morning of a
couple of years before when he had cut from a magazine a
page bearing a half-tone portrait and had pinned it above his
book-shelf. HAGAR ASHENDYNE had said the legend
below. The rustle of the palms outside his hut came to him,
and the mist of early morning above the waters.</p>

<p>The clock on Hagar's mantel-shelf struck ten with a silvery
stroke.</p>

<p>Denny started. "I've got to go&mdash;work's calling!"</p>

<p>"I had rather hear you say, at ten o'clock, that sleep was
calling," said Hagar. "You're working too hard, Rose says
so, and I say so." She looked at him with friendliness deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
and tender, soft and bright. "Almost Denny's only fault is
that he makes his work his god rather than his servant. At
times he's perilously near offering it a human sacrifice. Why
will you, Denny?"</p>

<p>"There's so much to do and so few are doing it," said
Denny. His eyes were upon the great forest bough, but he
seemed to be looking beyond it, down long, long vistas. "I
don't know that I worship work. But I want every prisoner
of wrong to rebel. And there's no time to waste when you
have to pass the word along to so many cells. Sometimes I
feel, too, like sitting down and playing, but when I do, I
always begin after a little to hear the chains." He laughed.
"And I like you and Rose preaching <i>dolce far niente</i>! If ever
there were two who had the power of work&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"All the same," said Hagar, "go to bed before two o'clock,
won't you?"</p>

<p>He shook hands around and was gone. "What a wonderful
face!" said Lily; and Fay nodded. "A kind of worn, warrior
angel&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hagar took Lily's hand and kissed it. "You've defined
Denny to a nicety! 'A kind of worn, warrior angel'&mdash;I like
that!... No, don't go! It isn't late."</p>

<p>"We'll stay, then, just one other half-hour. And now,"
said Lily, "tell me about yourself. We see your name, of
course, and what the papers think you are doing. But you
yourself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I myself?" said Hagar. "Ah, if you'll tell me, I'll
tell you!" The great bough of red leaves against the wall was
repeated in miniature by a spray upon the table, resting in a
piece of cloudy Venetian glass. Hagar took it from the vase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
and sat studying it, colour and line. She sat at ease in the
deep chair, her long, slender limbs composed, her head thrown
back against green-bronze, an arm bent and raised, the
wine-red spray in her hand. "What," she said, "does a man
or woman do in a dusty day's march of every great transit?
About that is what I and many others have been doing, in
this age as in other ages. Millions of minds to reach with a
statement that for reasons of weight the column must surmount
such a hill and again such a hill, the line of march
lying truly on higher levels. The statement did not originate
with the messengers of this or any other age; it is social, and
the inner urge would send the marchers somehow on, but
there is needed interpreting, clarifying, articulation&mdash;hence
the office that we fill, though we fill it as yet, I know, weakly
enough! So it means a preoccupation with communication&mdash;ways
and means of reaching minds. And that, lacking a
developed telepathy, means the spoken and the written
word. And that means, seeing we have such great numbers
to reach, a continuing endeavour to reach people in congregation.
And that means arrangement, going from place to
place, much time that you sigh for consumed, some weariness,
a great number of petty happenings&mdash;and a vast insight into
life and the way it is lived and the beings who live it! It
means contacts with reality and a feeding the springs of
humour and an acquaintance with the truly astonishing
forest of human motives. And there is organization work
and correspondence, and much of what might be called
drudgery unless you can put the glow about it.... And there
is the weaving all the time of the web of unity. The human
family, and the dying-out before love and understanding of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
invidious distinctions. The world one home, and men one
man, though of an infinite variety, and women one woman,
though of an infinite variety, and children one child, and the
open road before the three. And back of the three, Oneness.
The Great Pulse&mdash;out, the Many; in, the One.... So I
with others speak and write and go about and work."</p>

<p>When the clock struck again, Lily and John Fay said
good-night. Lily was to come once more before her boat
sailed.</p>

<p>Hagar looked at Fay. "You are going to England, too?"</p>

<p>He hesitated. "I've said so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's just built a great bridge," said Lily, "and he hasn't
really taken a holiday for years. Robert and I want him just
as long as he will travel with us."</p>

<p>When they were gone, Hagar went to the window and
looked out far and wide upon the city settling to its rest.
Here, to-night, would be deep repose, here fevered tossing,
here perhaps no sleep at all. There would be death chambers
and birth chambers&mdash;a many of each. And spiritual death
chambers and spiritual birth chambers and the trodden
middle rooms, minds that cried, "Light, more light!" and
minds that said, "We see as it is." ... And over all, the suns
so far away they were but glittering points. Hagar's gaze
moved across the heavens from host to host. "Ah, if you
were hieroglyphics, and we could find the key&mdash;"</p>

<p>She came back to the lamplit table; Thomasine away,
Mary Magazine asleep&mdash;the place was alone with her. She
had been tired, but she did not feel so now. She sat down,
put her arms above her head and her eyes upon the forest
bough, and began to think.... She thought visually with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
colour and light and form, luminous images parting the mist,
rising in the great "interior sphere." She sat there till the
clock struck twelve, then she rose, put out the lights, opened
every window. In the east, above the roofs, glittered Orion,
with Aldebaran red and mighty and the glimmering Pleiades.
Hagar stood and gazed. She lifted her eyes toward the zenith&mdash;Capella
and Algol and the street whose dust is stars between.
Her lips moved, she raised her hand. "All hail!" she
said; then turning from the window opened the door that led
into her bedroom. It was a white and fair and simple place.
As she undressed, she was thinking of the October woods at
Gilead Balm.</p>

<p>Three days later, at the hotel, Lily and John Fay had a
short but momentous conversation. "<i>Do</i> you want to go,
John? I don't want you to go if you don't want to go, you
know."</p>

<p>"That's what I came to talk to you about," said Fay. "I
have my stateroom. The boat sails day after to-morrow.
I've written to men I know in London and in Paris. I want
to see them. They're men I've worked with. I want to see
Robert. I even want to keep on seeing you, Lily! I've been
about as eager as a boy for that run over Europe with the
two of you. And I don't want to disappoint you and Robert,
if it is the least disappointment. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know that she'll ever marry," said Lily. "She'll
not, unless she finds some one alike to strengthen and be
strengthened by. A lot of the reasons for which women used
to marry are out of court with her. Even what we call love&mdash;she
won't feel it now for anything less than something that
matches her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>Fay walked across the floor, stood at the window a moment,
then came back. "I won't fence," he said. "It's
simple truth, however you divined it. And I'm going to
stay. I don't match her, but I've never proposed to stop
growing."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII<br />

RALPH</h2>


<p>Fay stayed. Lily's farewell note to Hagar merely said that
after all he was not sailing with her and that she hoped Hagar
would let him be among her friends. He made a good friend.
Fay himself wrote to her, stating that he would be much in
New York that autumn and winter and asking if he might
come to see her. She answered yes, but that she herself was
often away; he would have to take the chance of not finding
her. He came, and she was away, came again, and she was
away; then she wrote and asked him to dine with her on such
an evening. He went, and it was an evening to mark with a
white stone, to keep a lamp burning before in the mind. He
asked how he could find out where she would be, since it
was evident that she was speaking here and there. She
nodded; she was working hard that autumn, oftenest in
company with Rose Darragh, but often, too, with Elizabeth
Eden and Marie Caton, with Rachel and Molly Josslyn. She
showed him a list of meetings.</p>

<p>He thanked her and copied it down. "I see that your book
will presently be out."</p>

<p>"Yes. I hope that you will like it."</p>

<p>"I think that I shall. How hard you work!"</p>

<p>"Not harder than others. The secret is to learn concentration
and to fill all the interstices with the balm of leisure.
And to work with love of the World to Be."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>That November, together with Rose Darragh and Denny
and Elizabeth, she was often speaking in the poor and
crowded sections of the great city. Sometimes they talked
to the people in dim, small halls, sometimes in larger, brighter
places, sometimes there were street meetings. She grew
aware that often Fay was present. Sometimes, when the
meeting was over, he joined her; it began to be no infrequent
thing his going uptown upon the car with her. She began to
wonder.... Once in a street meeting she saw him near her as
she spoke. It was a good crowd and interested. As she
brought her brief, straight talk to a conclusion, Elizabeth
whispered to her, "Lucien couldn't come. Is there any one
else who could speak?" Hagar's eyes met John Fay's. "We
lack a speaker," she said. "Couldn't you&mdash;won't you?"
He nodded, stepped upon the box, and made a good speech.
His drawling, telling periods, his smiling, sea-blue eyes, a
story that he told and a blow or two out from the shoulder
caught the fancy and then the good-will of the crowd.</p>

<p>An old woman, Irish, wrinkled, her hands on her hips,
called out to him. "Be yez the new man? If yez are, I loike
yez foine!"</p>

<p>He laughed at and with her. "Do you? Then you'll have
to become a new woman to match me!"</p>

<p>The November dusk was closing in when the crowd dispersed.
Elizabeth with the other woman speaker faced toward
the Settlement. "Can't you come with me, Hagar?"</p>

<p>"No, not to-night. There are letters and letters&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fay asked if he might go uptown with her.</p>

<p>She nodded. "Yes, if you like. Good-night, Elizabeth&mdash;good-night,
Mary Ware; good-night, good-night!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>They took a surface car. She sat for a minute with her eyes
shut.</p>

<p>"Are you very tired?"</p>

<p>She smiled. "No, I am not tired. After all, why should it
fatigue more than standing in cathedrals, walking through
art galleries? But I was thinking of something.... Let us
sit quietly for a while."</p>

<p>The minutes went by. At last she spoke. "I liked what
you said, and the way you said it. Thank you."</p>

<p>"You do not need to thank me. Had I been less convinced,
I might have spoken because you asked me to. As it is, I was
willing to serve the truth."</p>

<p>"Ah, good!..."</p>

<p>There was another silence; then she began to speak of the
light and thunder of the city about them, and then of a book
she was reading. When they left the car it was dark&mdash;they
walked westward together.</p>

<p>"Have you heard from Lily?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She and Robert are going first to the Riviera, then
to Sicily."</p>

<p>"Both are very lovely. Why do you not change your mind
and go?"</p>

<p>"I like it better here."</p>

<p>The evening was dark, clear and windy, with the stars
trooping out.</p>

<p>"When," asked Hagar, "are you going to build another bridge?"</p>

<p>He pondered it. "I've been building for a long time and
I'm going to build for another long time. Do you grudge me
this half-year in between?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not. I was only wondering&mdash;" She broke off and
began to talk about the Josslyns whom, it had turned out, he
knew and liked. Two weeks ago she had dined there with
him, and Christopher had taken occasion to tell her that
John Fay was about the rightest all right he knew.... She
had not really needed the telling. She had a good deal of
insight herself.</p>

<p>They came to the great arched door of the apartment
house, and there she told Fay good-night. When he was gone,
she stood for a moment in the paved lobby with its palm
or two, her eyes upon the clear darkness without; then she
turned to the elevator.</p>

<p>Upstairs, within her own doors, Thomasine met her. "Oh,
Hagar! It's Mr. Ralph&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ralph!"</p>

<p>Ralph had been abroad, and she had not seen him for a
long time.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Thomasine. "His boat came in yesterday
evening. And awhile ago he telephoned to ask you if he might
come to dinner with you, and I didn't know what to say, and
I told him you wouldn't be in till late; and he said did I think
you'd mind his coming, and I didn't know what to say, so I
said, 'No,' I couldn't think so; and he asked what time you
dined&mdash;and it's nearly seven now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you couldn't say anything else," said Hagar.
"Only I devoutly hope&mdash;" She moved toward her own
room. "I'll dress quickly."</p>

<p>"And don't you think," said Thomasine, "that I'd better
not dine with you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think just the contrary," answered Hagar, and vanished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>Ralph came. He was the Ralph of three years ago, of that
last autumn week at Gilead Balm, only with certain things
accentuated. He was richer, he had more and more a name in
finance; his state was now loudly and perpetually proud
of him. There was an indefinable hardening.... He was
very handsome, Thomasine thought; he looked tremendously
Somebody. He had been around the world&mdash;his physician
had sent him off because of a threatened breaking-down.
Apparently that had been staved off, pushed at least into a
closet to stay there a few years. He talked well, with vigorous,
clipped sentences, of Australia and China and India. Hagar,
sitting opposite him in a filmy black gown, kept the talk upon
travel. She had not seen him for eighteen months, and before
then, for a long while, their meetings had been casual, cold
and stiff enough, with upon his side an absurd hauteur. The
eighteen months had at least dissipated that.... Dinner
over, they went for coffee back to the apartment, and
Thomasine determinedly disappeared. Old Gilead Balm talk
was in Thomasine's mind. Ralph Coltsworth and Hagar
Ashendyne were to mate&mdash;Old Miss had somehow kept that
in the air, even so long, long ago.</p>

<p>In the grave and restful room with its shaded lights Hagar
poured a cup of coffee for her cousin and gave it to him.</p>

<p>Taking it, he took for a moment also her two hands, long,
slender, and very finely made. "Ringless!" he said.</p>

<p>Hagar, withdrawing them, poured her own coffee. "I
have never cared to wear jewels. A necklace and an old
brooch or two of my mother's are almost the only things I have."</p>

<p>Ralph looked about the room. The bough of flaming maple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
was gone and in its place rested a great branch of cone-bearing
white pine.</p>

<p>Her eyes followed his. "I can see the forest through it.
Do you remember the great pine above the spring?"</p>

<p>His gaze still roamed. "And you call this home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is home."</p>

<p>"Without a man?"</p>

<p>She smiled. "Do you think there can be no home without
a man?"</p>

<p>He drank his coffee; then, putting down the cup, rose and
moved about the deep and wide place. She watched him from
her armchair, long and slim as Diana in her black robe. He
looked at the walls with their rows of cabined thought and the
pictures above, at the great library table with its tokens of
work, and then, standing before the wide, clear windows, at
the multitudinous lights of the world without. A sound as of
a distant sea came through the glass. "And without a child?"</p>

<p>Her clear voice sounded behind him. "You are mistaken,"
she said. "My work is my child. One human being serves
and expresses in one way and one in another, and I think it is
not the office which is higher or lower, but only the mind
with which the office is performed. Did I ever meet a man
whom I loved and who was my comrade, and who loved me
and saw in me his comrade, my home would probably open to
that man. And we two might say, 'Now in cleanliness and
joy and awe will we bring a child into our home.' ... I think
that would be a happy thing to happen. But if it does not
happen, none the less will I have my earthly home as I have
my unearthly, and be happy in it, and none the less will I do
world-work and rejoice in the doing. And if it happened, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
would be but added bliss&mdash;it would be by no means all the
bliss, or all the world, nor should it be. We grow larger
than that.... And now, having answered your question,
come! let us sit down and talk about what you are doing and
when you are going down to Hawk Nest. I had a letter from
Gilead Balm last week&mdash;from Aunt Serena."</p>

<p>He came and sat down. "The last time I was at Gilead
Balm&mdash;two years and a half ago&mdash;they said they had
ceased to write to you."</p>

<p>"They have begun again," said Hagar calmly. "Dear
Ralph, we live in the twentieth century. You yourself are
here to-night, eating my bread and salt."</p>

<p>"Have you been to Gilead Balm?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I went last summer, and again the summer before.
Not for long, for a little while. Grandfather and grandmother
and Aunt Serena said some hard things, but I think they
enjoyed saying them, and I could ramble over the old place,
and, indeed, I think, though they would never have said so,
that they were glad to have me there. I will not quarrel.
They are so feeble&mdash;the Colonel and Old Miss. I do not
think they can live many years longer."</p>

<p>"Are you going again this summer?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>They talked again of his journey and recovered health, of
New York, of the political and financial condition of the country;
or rather he gave his view upon this and she sat studying
him, her fine, long hands folded in her lap. What with question
and remark she kept him for a long time upon general
topics, or upon his increasing part in the subtle machinery
behind so much that made general talk;&mdash;but at last, skilfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
as she fenced, he came back to personal life and to his
resentment of all her attitude.... He had thought that time
and absence had cured his passion for her. Even a month ago
he had told himself that there was left only family interest,
old boyish memories. He disapproved intensely of the way
she thought of things; she was not at all the wife for him.
Sylvie Carter was&mdash;he would go to see Sylvie just as soon as
he reached New York.... And then, upon the boat, coming
over, it was of Hagar that he dreamed all the time. Like a
gathering thunderstorm it was all coming back. Landing in
New York he had only thought of her, all last night and to-day.
It was an obsession, he told himself that&mdash;he could see
that once he had her, possessed her, owned her, he would
fight her through life ... or she would fight him ... and all
the same the obsession had him, whirling him like a leaf in
storm.</p>

<p>He spoke with a suddenness startling to himself. "What is
between us is all this fog of damnable ideas that has arisen
in the last twenty years! If it wasn't for that you would
marry me."</p>

<p>Hagar took the jade Buddha from the table and weighed
it in her hands. "Oh, give me patience&mdash;" she murmured.</p>

<p>He rose and began to pace the floor. The physical, the
passionate side of him was in storm. He was not for nothing a
Coltsworth. Coltsworths were dominating people, they were
masterful. They wished to prevail, body and point of view,
point of view, perhaps, no less than body. They were not content
to have their scheme of life and to allow another a like
liberty; their scheme must lie upon and smother under the
other's. They wished submissiveness of mind&mdash;the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
person's mind. They wished it in their relations with men&mdash;Ralph
himself preferred subservient officials, subservient
secretaries, subservient boards, subservient legislators. He
preferred men to listen in the club, he liked a deferential murmur
from his acquaintance. He had followers whom he called
friends. A certain number of these truly admired him; he was
to them feudal and splendid. He was a Coltsworth and Coltsworths
liked to dominate the minds and fortunes of men.
When it came to collective womankind, they might have said
that they had really never considered the question&mdash;naturally
men dominated women. To them God was male. They
would have agreed with the Kentucky editor that the feminist
movement was an audacious attempt to change the sex
of Deity.... The thing that angered the Coltsworths through
and through was Revolt. Political, economic, intellectual,
spiritual&mdash;Revolt was Revolt, whatever adjective went
before! Rage boiled up in the mind of the master. And when
the revolted was not perturbed, or anxious or fluttered, but
stood aloof and was aloof, when the revolt was successful,
when the rebellion had become revolution and the new flag
was up and the citadel impregnable&mdash;the sense of wrath and
injury overflowed like the waves of Phlegethon. It overflowed
now with Ralph.</p>

<p>He turned from the window. "All this rebellion of women
is unthinkable!"</p>

<p>Hagar looked at him somewhat dreamily. "However, it
has occurred."</p>

<p>"Things can't change like that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The answer to that is that they have changed."</p>

<p>She sat and smiled at him, quite eluding him, a long way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
off. "Do you think that only mind in man rebels? Mind in
woman does it too. And it comes about that there are always
more rebels, men and women. We are quite numerous to-day....
But there are women who do not rebel, as there are
men. There are many women who will grant you your
every premise, who are horrified in company with you, horrified
at us others.... Why do you not wish to mate among
your own kind?"</p>

<p>"I wish to mate with <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "That you cannot do.... There is
being drawn a line. Some men and women are on one side of
it, and some men and women are on the other side of it.
There is taking place a sorting-out.... In the things that make
the difference you are where you were when Troy fell. I
cannot go back, down all those slopes of Time."</p>

<p>"I am afire for you."</p>

<p>"You wake in me no answering fire." She rose. "I will
talk about much with you, but I will talk no longer about
love. You may take your choice. Stay and talk as my old
playmate and cousin, or say good-night and good-bye."</p>

<p>"If I go," said Ralph hoarsely, "I shall not come again&mdash;I
shall not ask you again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ralph, Ralph! do you think I shall weep for that?...
You do think that I shall weep for that!... You are mad!"</p>

<p>"By God!" said Ralph, and quivered, "I wish that we
were together in a dark wood&mdash;I wish that you were in a
captured city, and I was coming through the broken gate&mdash;"
Suddenly he crossed the few feet between them, caught and
crushed her in his arms, bruising her lips with his. "Just be a
woman&mdash;you dark, rich thing with wings&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>Hagar had a physical strength for which he was unprepared.
Exerting it, she freed herself, and in the same instant
and as deliberately as swiftly, struck him across the face with
her open hand. "Good-bye, to you!" she said in a thrilling
voice.</p>

<p>They stared at each other for a moment across space.
Then Hagar said quietly. "You had better go, Ralph...."</p>

<p>He went. When the door had closed behind him, she stood
very still for a few moments, her eyes upon the pine bough.
The excess of colour slowly ebbed from her face, the anger
died in her eyes. "Oh, all of us poor, struggling souls!" she
said. Obeying some inner impulse she first lowered, then
extinguished the lights in the room and moved to one of the
windows. She threw up the sash and the keen, autumnal
night streamed in upon her. The window-seat was low and
broad. She sat there with her head thrown back against the
frame, and let the night and the high, starry heaven and the
moving air absorb and lift her. It was very clear and there
seemed depths on depths above. Hyades and Pleiades, and
the Charioteer, and Andromeda Bound, and Perseus climbing
the steep sky. "We are all bound and limited&mdash;we
are all on the lower slopes of Time&mdash;down in the fens with
the lower nature. It is only a question of more or less&mdash;Aspiration
born and strengthening, or Aspiration yet in the
womb. Then what room for anger because another is where
I have been&mdash;because another, coming upward, rests awhile
in the dungeon that was also mine, perhaps it was yesterday,
perhaps it was ages ago?... Where I am to-day will
seem dungeon enough to that which one day I shall be....
And so with him, and so with us all...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>A month after this she found among her letters one morning
four smoothly ecstatic pages from Sylvie Carter. Ralph
had asked Sylvie to marry him, and Sylvie had said Yes.
Sylvie wrote that she expected to be very happy, and that
she was going to do her best to make Ralph so, too. The
next day brought a half-page from Ralph. It stated that
something Hagar had said had set him to thinking. She had
said that there was being a line drawn and that some men
and some women were finding themselves together on either
side. He thought there was truth in it, and that, after all, one
should marry within one's class; otherwise a perpetual clash
of opinions, fatal to love. There followed a terse announcement
of his engagement to Sylvie, and he signed himself,
"Your affectionate cousin, Ralph Coltsworth."</p>

<p>But it was Old Miss whose letter was wholly aggrieved and
indignant....</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII<br />

GILEAD BALM</h2>


<p>The second letter from Old Miss came in February. The
Colonel had suddenly failed and taken to his bed. Old Miss
believed that he would get up again,&mdash;there was, she said,
no reason why he shouldn't,&mdash;but in the mean time there
he lay. He was a little wandering in his mind, and he had
taken to thinking that Hagar was in the house, and a little
girl still, and demanding to see her. Old Miss suggested that
she should come to Gilead Balm.</p>

<p>She went at once. On the train, thundering south through a
snowy night, she lay awake until half of her journey was over.
Scenes and moments, occurrences of the outer and inner life,
went by her mind like some endless, shifting tapestry. Childhood,
girlhood, womanhood, work and play, the daily,
material task and the inner lift, lift, and ever-strengthening
knowledge of the impalpable&mdash;that last was not tapestry;
it was height and breadth and depth, and something more.
The old, wide travel came back to her; shifting gleams of
Eastern cities, deserts, time-broken temples, mountains,
vineyards, haunted groves, endless surrounding, azure,
murmuring seas.... Medway, white-clothed and helmeted,
in his rolling chair.... The whistle shrieked; the train
stopped with a jar at some lighted station, then, regathering
its forces, rushed and roared on through the February night.
Now it was the last three years and more: they passed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
panorama before her. Stages and stairways and scaffoldings
by which the world-spirit might mount an inch: ferments
and leavens: voices telling of democracy and fair
play and care for your neighbour's freedom as for your own,
your woman-neighbour and your man-neighbour. Through
her mind ran all the enormous detail of the work being
pursued over all the country; countless meetings, speeches,
appeals, talks to a dozen gathered together or to two or
three; letters and letters and letters, press and magazine
utterances, organization, the difficult raising of money, legislative
work, petitions, canvassing; drudgery in myriad
detail, letters and letters, voice and pen.... And all the
opposition&mdash;blind bigotry to be met, and a maniac fear of
change, inertia, tradition, habit, the dead past's hand, cold
and heavy&mdash;and all the interested opposition, the things
whose book the movement did not suit&mdash;and all the lethargy
of womankind itself.... And in the very camp, in the
huge, chaotic movement itself, as in all the past's vast human
movements, recurring frictions, antagonisms, small jealousies,
flags set up by individuals, pacifications and smoothings,
bringing compatibles together, keeping incompatibles apart....
A contending with outer oppositions and inner weaknesses,
resisting discouragement, fighting cynicism, acknowledging
the vast road to travel, keeping on.... She knew
nothing that was at once so weak and so mighty as the
Woman Movement. One who was deep within it might feel
at times a vast weariness, impatience, and despair ... but
deep within it you never left it. Here you dealt with clay
that was so cold and lumpish it seemed that no generous idea
could germinate within; here you dealt with stuff so friable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
light, and disintegrative that the thought would come that it
were better to cast it to the winds ... but you did not; you
comforted your soul with the very much that was noble, and
you hoped for the other that was not yet noble, and you went
on&mdash;went on. It was all you yourself&mdash;you had within you
the intractable clay and the stuff light as chaff, inconsequent;
but you went on transmuting, lifting.... There was no
other hope, no other course, deep down no other wish. So
with the Woman Movement.... Another station. Hagar
looked out at the lights and the hurrying forms; then, as the
train roared into the white countryside, at what could be
seen of the fields and hills and storm-bent trees. She was
thinking now of Gilead Balm and her childhood and her
mother. She seemed to lie again, close beside Maria, on the
big, chintz-covered sofa. At last she slept, lying so.</p>

<p>Captain Bob and Lisa met her at the station, three miles
from Gilead Balm. Captain Bob had a doleful mien. "Oh,
yes, the Colonel's better&mdash;but I don't think he's so much
better. He's getting old&mdash;and Lisa and I are getting old,
too, aren't we old girl?&mdash;old like Luna and going away
pretty soon like Luna. Well, Gipsy, you're looking natural&mdash;No,
it's been an open winter down here&mdash;not much
snow." He put her in the carriage, and they drove slowly to
Gilead Balm, over the heavy country road.</p>

<p>Old Miss was well; Serena was well; Captain Bob himself
had had rheumatism, but he was better.&mdash;The Colonel
didn't look badly; it was only that he didn't seem to want
to get out of bed, and that every little while he set the clock
back and rambled on about things and people&mdash;"It's creepy
to hear him," said Captain Bob. "He thinks young Dr. Bude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
is old Dr. Bude, and he thinks that Maria is alive, and that
she won't let you come into the room. And then it'll
change like that, and he's just as much himself as he ever
was&mdash;more so, in fact.&mdash;Hi, Li-sa! let that rooster alone&mdash;"</p>

<p>The house cedars showed over the brown hills. "Dr. Bude
wanted Old Miss to get a trained nurse because somebody's
got more or less to watch at night. But Old Miss wouldn't
hear to it. She don't approve of women training for nurses,
so she's got young Ph&oelig;be and Isham's second wife&mdash;and I
think myself," said Captain Bob, "that I wouldn't want a
young white woman that I couldn't order round."</p>

<p>Red brick and brown fields and the black-green of many
cedars&mdash;here was Gilead Balm, looking just as it used to
look of a February. The air was cold and still, the day a grey
one, the smoke from the chimneys moving upward sluggishly.
Miss Serena came down the porch steps and greeted Hagar
as she stepped from the carriage.</p>

<p>"Yes, your old room. Did you have a tiresome journey?&mdash;Is
your trunk coming? Then I'll send it up as soon as they
bring it. Young Ph&oelig;be, you take Miss Hagar's bag up to her
room. The fire's lighted, Hagar, and Mimy shall make you
a cup of coffee. We're glad to see you."</p>

<p>The old room, her mother's and her own! Hagar had not
been in it in winter-time for a long while. When Ph&oelig;be was
gone, she sat in the winged chair by the fire and regarded the
familiar wall-paper and the old, carved wardrobe and the
four-poster bed and the sofa where Maria had lain, and,
between the dimity curtains at the windows, the winter
landscape. The fire was bright and danced in the old mahogany;
the old chintz covers were upon the chair and sofa&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
old pattern, only the hues faded. Hagar rose, took off her
travelling dress, bathed and put on a dark, silken dressing-gown.
She took the pins from her hair and let it stream; it
was like Maria's. She stood for a moment, her eyes upon the
pallid day, the rusty cedars without the window, then she
went to the chintz sofa and lay down in the firelight, piling
the pillows behind her head, taking, half-consciously, the
posture that oftenest in her memory she saw Maria take.
Her mother was present with her; there came an expression
into her face that was her mother's. Old Miss knocked at the
door, and entered without waiting for the "Come in!"</p>

<p>Hagar rose and embraced her grandmother; then Old Miss
sat down in the winged chair and her granddaughter went
back to the sofa. The two gazed at each other. Hagar did
not know that she looked to-day like Maria, and Old Miss
did not examine the springs and sources of a mounting anger
and sense of injury. She sat very straight, with her knitting
in her hand, wearing a cap upon her smoothly parted hair, in
which there were yet strands of brown, wearing a black stuff
skirt and low-heeled shoes over white stockings; comely yet,
and as ever, authoritative.</p>

<p>"I am so very sorry about grandfather," said Hagar.
"Uncle Bob thinks he is better&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is better. He will be well presently. I should
not," said Old Miss coldly, "have written asking you to come
but that Dr. Bude advised it."</p>

<p>"I was very glad to come."</p>

<p>"Dr. Bude is by no means the man his father was. The age
is degenerate. And so"&mdash;said Old Miss&mdash;"Sylvie Maine
has taken the prize right from under your hand."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" said Hagar. The corners of her lips rose; her look
that had been rather still and brooding broke into sunshine.
"If you call it that!&mdash;I hope that Ralph and Sylvie will be
very happy."</p>

<p>"They will probably be extraordinarily happy. She is not
one of your new women. I detest," said Old Miss grimly,
"your new women."</p>

<p>Silence. Hagar lay back against the pillows and she looked
more and more to Old Miss like Maria. Old Miss's needles
clicked.</p>

<p>"When may I see grandfather?" asked Hagar, and she kept
her voice friendly and quiet.</p>

<p>"He is sleeping now. When he wakes up, if he asks for
you you may go in. I wouldn't stay long.&mdash;And what have
you been doing this winter?"</p>

<p>"Various things, grandmother. Thomasine and I have
been working pretty hard. Thomasine sent her regards to
every one at Gilead Balm."</p>

<p>"If you hadn't thrown away Medway's million dollars
you wouldn't have had to work," said Old Miss. "Maria
was perfectly spendthrift, and of course you take after
her.&mdash;What kind of work do you mean you have been
doing?"</p>

<p>"I have been writing, of course. And then other work
connected with movements in which I am interested."</p>

<p>Old Miss's needles clicked again! "Unsexing women and
unsettling the minds of working-people. I saw a piece in a
paper. Preposterous! But it's just what Maria would have
liked to have done."</p>

<p>Silence again; then Hagar leaned across and took up her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
grandmother's work. "What is it? An afghan? It's lovely
soft wool."</p>

<p>"When," asked Old Miss, "are you going to marry&mdash;and
whom?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, grandmother, that I am going to marry, or
whom."</p>

<p>"You should have married Ralph.... All these years have
you had any other offers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, grandmother."</p>

<p>"While you were with Medway?"</p>

<p>"Yes, grandmother."</p>

<p>"Have you had any since you set up in this remarkable
way for yourself?"</p>

<p>Hagar laughed. "No, grandmother&mdash;unless you except
Ralph."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Old Miss in grim triumph; "I knew you
wouldn't!"</p>

<p>Miss Serena came to the door. "Father's awake and he
wants to see Hagar."</p>

<p>But when Hagar went down and into the big room and up
to the great bed, the Colonel declared her to be Maria, grew
excited, and said that she shouldn't keep his grandchild from
him. "I tell you, woman, Medway and I are going to use
authority! The child's Medway's&mdash;Medway's next of kin
by every law in the land! He can take her from you, and, by
God! he shall do it!"</p>

<p>"Father," said Miss Serena, "this is Hagar, grown up."</p>

<p>But the Colonel grew violently angry. "You are all
lying!&mdash;a man's family conspiring against him! That
woman's my daughter-in-law&mdash;my son's wife, dependent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
on me for her bread and shelter and setting up her will against
mine! And now she's all for keeping from me my grandchild&mdash;she's
hiding Gipsy in closets and under the stairs&mdash;You
have no right. It's not your child, it's Medway's child!
That's law. You ought to be whipped!"</p>

<p>"Grandfather," said Hagar, "do you remember Alexandria
and the mosques and the Place Mahomet Ali?"</p>

<p>"Why, exactly," said the Colonel. "Well, Gipsy, we
always wanted to travel, didn't we? That dragoman seems
to know his business&mdash;we're going down to Cairo to-day
and out to see the pyramids. Want to come along?"</p>

<p>Day followed day at Gilead Balm. Sometimes the Colonel's
mind wandered over the seas of creation, with the pilot
asleep at the helm; sometimes the pilot suddenly awoke,
though it was not apt to be for long. It was eerie when the
pilot awoke; when he suddenly sat there, gaunt, with a parchment
face and beak-like nose and straying white hair, and in
a cool, drawling voice asked intelligent questions about the
hour and the season and the plantation happenings.</p>

<p>At such times, if Hagar were not already in the room, he
demanded to see her. She came, sat by him in the great chair,
offered to read to him. He was not infrequently willing for
her to do this. She read both prose and verse to him this
winter. Sometimes he did not wish her to read; he wanted to
talk. When this was the case&mdash;the pilot being awake&mdash;it
was her life away from Gilead Balm that he oftenest chose to
comment upon. That he knew the content of her life hardly
at all mattered, as little to the Colonel as it mattered to Old
Miss and Miss Serena. They were going to let fly their
arrows; if there was no target in the direction in which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
shot, at least they were in sublime ignorance of the fact.
Hagar let them talk. Not only the Colonel&mdash;Gilead Balm
was dying.... In the middle of a sarcastic sentence the pilot
would drop asleep again; in a moment the barque was at the
mercy of every wandering wind. Hagar became Maria and
he gibbered at her.</p>

<p>Young Dr. Bude came and went. February grew old and
passed into March; March, cold and sunny, with high winds,
wheeled by; April came with tender light, with Judas trees
and bloodroot, and the white cherry trees in a mist of bloom;
and still the Colonel lay there, and now the pilot waked and
now the pilot slept.</p>

<p>May came. Dr. Bude stayed in the house. One evening at
dusk the Colonel suddenly opened his eyes upon his family
gathered about his bed. Old Miss was sitting, upright and
still, in the great chair at the bed-head. Miss Serena had a
low chair at the foot, and Captain Bob was near, his old, grey
head buried in his hands. There was also an Ashendyne close
kinsman, and a Coltsworth&mdash;not Ralph. Dr. Bude waited
in the background. Hagar stood behind Miss Serena.</p>

<p>Colonel Argall Ashendyne looked out from his pillow.
"Wasn't the Canal good enough? Who wants their Railroad&mdash;damn
them! And after the Railroad there'll be something
else.... Public Schools, too!... This country's getting too
damnably democratic!" His eyes closed, his face seemed to
sink together. Dr. Bude came from the hearth and, bending
over, laid his finger upon the pulse. The Colonel again
opened his eyes. They were fastened now on Hagar, standing
behind Miss Serena. "Well, Gipsy!" he said with cheerfulness,
"It's a pretty comfortable boat, eh? We'll make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
voyage before we know it." His hands touched the bed.
"Steamer chairs! I don't think I was ever in one before.
Lean back and see the wide ocean stretch before you! The
wide ocean ... the wide ocean ...</p>

<div class="poem">
"'Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!'<br />
</div>

<p>"That's Byron, you know, Gipsy.... The wide ocean...."</p>

<p>His eyes glazed. He sank back. Dr. Bude touched the
wrist again; then, straightening himself, turned and spoke to
Old Miss.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV<br />

BRITTANY</h2>


<p>"She hasn't had a holiday for nearly four years," said
Molly. "I'm glad she's gone for this summer. She wouldn't
take Thomasine&mdash;she said she wanted to be all, all alone,
just for three months. Then she would come back to work."</p>

<p>"Brittany&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. A little place on the coast that she knew. She said
she wanted the sea. I thought perhaps that she had written
to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not since May," said John Fay. "There was a proposed
extension of a piece of work of mine in the West. I was called
out there to see about it, and I had to go. I was kept for
weeks. I tried to get back, but I couldn't&mdash;I was in honour
bound. Then when I came her boat had sailed. And
now I&mdash;"</p>

<p>He measured the table with his fingers. "Do you think
she would hate me if I turned up in that place in Brittany?"</p>

<p>Molly considered it. "She's a reasonable being. Brittany
isn't for the benefit of just one person."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you see I should want to talk to her."</p>

<p>Molly pondered that, too. "Well, I should try, I think. If
she doesn't want to talk she will tell you so...."</p>

<p>Hagar's village was a small village, a grey patch of time-worn
houses, set like a lichen against a cliff with a heath
above. Before it ran a great and far stretch of brown sands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
There was a tiny harbour where the fishing-boats came in,
and all beyond the thundering sea. The place boasted a small
inn, but she did not stay there. The widow of the curé had
to let a clean large room, overlooking a windy garden, and
the widow and her one servant set a table with simple, well-cooked
fare. Hagar stayed here, though most of the time,
indeed, she stayed out upon the brown, shell-strewn, far-stretching
sands.</p>

<p>She walked for miles, or, down with the women at evening,
she watched the boats come one by one to haven, or, far from
the village, beneath some dune-like heap of sand, she sat
with her hands about her knees and watched the shifting
colour of the sea. She had a book with her; sometimes she
read in it, and sometimes it lay unopened. All the colours
went over the sea, the surf murmured, the sea-birds flew, the
salt wind bent the sparse grass at the top of the dune. On
such an afternoon, after long, motionless dreaming, she
changed her posture, turning her eyes toward the distant
village. A man was walking toward her, over the firm sand.
She watched him at first dreamily, then, suddenly, with a
quickened breath. While the distance between them was yet
great, she knew it to be Fay.</p>

<p>He came up to her and held out his hand. She put hers in
it. "Did I startle you?" he said. "If you don't want me, I
will go away."</p>

<p>"I thought you were bridge-building in the West."</p>

<p>"I could get away at last. I crossed the Atlantic because
I wanted to see you. Do you mind, very much?"</p>

<p>"Do I mind seeing you here, in Brittany? No, I do not
know that I mind that.... Sit down and tell me about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
America. America has seemed so far away, these still, still
days ... farther away than the sun and the moon."</p>

<p>Long and clean-limbed, with his sea-blue eyes and quizzical
look, Fay threw himself down upon the sand beside her.
They talked that day of people at home, of the work he had
been doing and of her long absence at Gilead Balm. She made
him see the place&mdash;the old man who had died&mdash;and Old
Miss and Miss Serena and Captain Bob and the servants and
Lisa.</p>

<p>"They are going to live on there?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Just as they have done, until they, too, die....
Oh, Gilead Balm!"</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, the sun making a red path across the
waters, and the red-sailed boats growing larger, coming
toward the land, they walked back to the village together.
He left her at the door of the curé's house. He himself was
staying at the inn. She did not ask him how long he would
stay, or if he was on his way to other, larger places. The
situation accepted itself.</p>

<p>There followed some days of wandering together, through
the little grey town, or over the green headland to a country
beyond of pine trees and Druid stones, or, in the evening
light, along the sands. They found a sailboat, with an old,
hale boatman, for hire, and they went out in this boat.
Sometimes the wind carried them along, swift as a leaf;
sometimes they went as in a sea-revery, so dreamily. The
boatman knew all the legends of the sea; he told them stories
of the King of Ys and the false Ahés, and then he talked of
the Pardons of his youth. Sometimes they skirted the coast,
sometimes they went so far out that the land was but an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
eastward-lying shadow. The next day, perhaps, they wandered
inland, over the heath among dolmens and menhirs,
or, seated on old wreckage upon the sands, the dark blue sea
before them, now they talked and now they kept company
with silence. They talked little rather than much. The place
was taciturn, and her mood made for quiet.</p>

<p>It was not until the fourth day that he told her for what he
had come. "But you know for what I came."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>"If you could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want," said Hagar, "more time. Will you let it all rest
for a little longer? I don't think I could tell you truly
to-day."</p>

<p>"As long as you wish," he said, "if only, in the end&mdash;"</p>

<p>Two days after this they went out in the afternoon in the
boat. It had been a warm day, with murk in the air. At the
little landing-place Fay, after a glance at the dim, hot arch of
the sky, asked the boatman if bad weather might be brewing.
But the Breton was positive.</p>

<p>"Nothing to-day&mdash;nothing to-day! To-morrow, perhaps,
m'sieu."</p>

<p>They went sailing far out, until the land sunk from sight.
An hour or two passed, pleasantly, pleasantly. Then suddenly
the wind, where they were, dropped like a stone. They
lay for an hour with flapping sail and watched the blue sky
grow pallid and then darken. A puff of wind, hot and heavy,
lifted the hair from their brows. It increased; the sky darkened
yet more; with an appalling might and swiftness the
worst storm of the half-year burst upon them. The wind
blew a hurricane; the sea rose; suddenly the mast went.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
Fay and the Breton battled with the wreckage, cut it loose&mdash;the
boat righted. But she had shipped water and her
timbers were straining and creaking. The wind was whipping
her away to the open sea, and the waves, continually
mounting, battered her side. There was a perceptible list.
Night was oncoming, and the fury above increasing.</p>

<p>Hagar braided her long hair that the wind had loosened
from its fastening. "We are in danger," she said to Fay.</p>

<p>"Yes. Can you swim?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But there would be no long swimming in this
sea."</p>

<p>They sat in the darkness of the storm. When the lightnings
flashed each had a vision of the other's face, tense and still.
There was nothing that could be done. The sailor, who was
hardy enough, now muttered prayers and now objurgations
upon the faithless weather. He tried to assure his passengers
that not St. Anne herself could have foreseen what was going
to occur that afternoon. Certainly Jean Gouillou had not.
"That's understood," said Hagar, smiling at him in a flash of
lightning; and, "Just do your best now," said Fay.</p>

<p>The wild storm continued. Wind and wave tossed and
drove the helpless boat. Now it laboured in the black trough
of the waves, now it staggered upon the summits; and always
it laboured more heavily, and always it was more laggard in
rising. The Breton and Fay took turns in bailing the water
out. It was now, save for the lightning, dark night. At last
it was seen&mdash;though still they worked on&mdash;that there was
little use in bailing. The boat grew heavier, more distressed.
The sea was running high.</p>

<p>"Some wave will swamp us?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. It is a matter of time&mdash;and not long time, I think."</p>

<p>Hagar put out her hands to him. "Then I will tell you
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>He took her hands. "Is it your answer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear.... Yes, my dear."</p>

<p>They bent toward each other&mdash;their lips met. "Now,
whether we live or whether we die&mdash;"</p>

<p>The wild storm continued. The slow sands of the night ran
on, and still the boat lived, though always more weakly, with
the end more certainly before her. The Breton crossed himself
and prayed. Hagar and Fay sat close together, hand in
hand. After midnight the storm suddenly decreased in force.
The lightning and thunder ceased, the clouds began to part.
In another hour there would be a sky all stars. The wind
that had been so loud and wild sank to a lingering, steady
moaning. There was left the tumultuous, lifted sea, and the
boat sunken now almost to her gunwales.</p>

<p>Fay spoke in a low voice. "Are you afraid of death?"</p>

<p>"No.... You cannot kill life."</p>

<p>"It will not be painful, going as we shall go&mdash;if it is to
happen. And to go together&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am glad that we are going together&mdash;seeing that we
are to go."</p>

<p>"Do you believe that&mdash;when it is over&mdash;we shall be
together still?"</p>

<p>"Consciously together?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I do not know. No one knows. No one can know&mdash;yet.
But I have faith that we shall persist, and that intelligently.
I do not think that we shall forget or ignore our old selves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
And if we wish to be together&mdash;and we do wish it&mdash;then I
think we may have power to compass it."</p>

<p>"It has sometimes seemed to me," said Fay, "that After
Death may prove to be just Life with something like fourth
dimensional powers. All this life a memory as of childhood,
and a power and freedom and scope undreamed of now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is possible. All things are possible&mdash;save extinction.&mdash;I
think, too, it will be higher, more spiritual.... At any
rate, I do not fear. I feel awe as before something unknown
and high."</p>

<p>"And I the same."</p>

<p>Off in the east the stars were paling, there was coming a
vague and mournful grey. The boat was sinking. The two
men had torn away the thwarts and with a piece of rope
lashed them together. It would be little more than a straw to
cling to, in the turbulent wide ocean, miles from land. All
were cold and numbed with the wind and the rain and the
sea.</p>

<p>Purple streaks came into the east, a chill and solemn lift
to all the sea and air and the roofless ether. Hagar and Fay
looked at the violet light, at the extreme and ghostly calm of
the fields of dawn. "It is coming now," said Fay, and put
his arm around her. The boat sank.</p>

<p>The three, clinging to the frail raft they had provided,
were swung from wave to wave beneath the glowing dawn....
The wind was stilled now, the water, under the rising sun,
smoothed itself out. They drifted, drifted; and now the sun
was an hour high.... "Look! look!" cried the Breton, and
they looked and saw a red sail coming toward them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>A day or two later Hagar and Fay met at the gate of the
curé's widow, and climbing through the grey town came out
upon the heath above. It was a high, clear afternoon, with a
marvellous blue sky. They walked until they came to a circle
of stones, raised there in the immemorial, dark past. When
they had wandered among them for a while, they rested,
leaning against the greatest menhir, looking out over the
grey-green, far-stretching heath to a line of sapphire sea.
"It grows like a dream," said Hagar. "Death, life&mdash;life,
death.... I think we are growing into something that transcends
both ... as we have known both."</p>

<p>"Hagar, do you love me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I love you.... It's a quiet love, but it's deep."</p>

<p>They sat down in the warm grass by the huge stone, and
now they talked and now they were silent and content.
Little by little they laid their plans.</p>

<p>"Let us go to London. I will go to Roger Michael's. We
will marry quietly there."</p>

<p>"Lily and Robert will want to come from Scotland."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll let them." Hagar laughed, a musical, sweet
laugh. "Thomson is in London with Mr. Greer. Dear old
Thomson! I think he'll have to come."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we have," said Fay, "a month in some old,
green, still, English country place?"</p>

<p>"With roses to the eaves and a sunken lane to wander
in and at night a cricket chirping on the hearth.... We'll
try."</p>

<p>"And in October sail for home."</p>

<p>"And in October sail for home."</p>

<p>She looked at him with eyes that smiled and yet were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
grave. "You're aware that you're marrying a working-woman,
who intends to continue to work?"</p>

<p>"I'm aware."</p>

<p>Her candid eyes continued to meet his. "I wish a child.
While it needs me and when it needs me, I shall be there."</p>

<p>His hand closed over hers. "Is it as though I did not know
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>She kissed him on the lips. "And you're aware that I
shall work on through life for the fairer social order? And
that, generally speaking, the Woman Movement has me for
keeps?"</p>

<p>"I'm aware. I'm going to help you."</p>

<p>"South America&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not wedded," said Fay, "to South American governments.
There are a plenty of bridges to be built in the
United States."</p>

<p>The grey-green silent heath stretched away to the shining
sea. The grasses waved around and between the grey altars
of the past, and the sky vaulted all, azure and splendid.
Two sea-birds passed overhead with a long, clarion cry. Two
butterflies hung poised upon a thistle beside them. The salt
wind blew from the sea as it had blown against man and
woman when these stones were raised. They sat and talked
until the sun was low in the west, and then, hand in hand,
walked back toward the village.</p>
